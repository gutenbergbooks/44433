    <h2>
      TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The description given by one of the authors of <i>Jauvfry</i> about the
      origin of the romance, and the evidence afforded by the French adapter
      concerning the Mss. wherein it is contained, make it unnecessary for me to
      dwell upon these particulars.
    </p>
    <p>
      The veneration in which King Arthur's name is held by all lovers of the
      early romantic history of Britain will give the tale a strong
      recommendation in such eyes; while the personages with which it deals
      render the appearance of its characters in an English dress the more
      pleasing and appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
      As answerable for the fashion and material of the costume, I may be
      permitted to say a few words concerning the rule which has guided me in
      producing it. Keeping in view that the original romance is a poem in form
      and composition, I have endeavoured, in my translation, still to preserve
      the poetic character; and though compelled to base my work upon a prose
      version, I have tried, within certain limits, rather to restore its
      original shape, than allow it, by the second ordeal to which it is thus
      subjected, to lose it altogether. Whether such attempt, however honestly
      conceived, has been properly carried out, must be determined by my
      readers.

    <h2>
      PREFACE TO THE FRENCH VERSION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The literary world of France scarce knows the extent of its own riches. In
      the catacombs of its libraries and archives there is a heap of unknown
      jewels which would give a new and brighter lustre to its poetic wreath.
      The &ldquo;great age&rdquo; did not even suspect their existence; the eighteenth
      century passed over without bestowing on them, a glance; and if, in our
      days, a few of our learned brethren have conceived the idea of drawing
      them to light, the rumour of their labours, which moreover were both
      superficial and incomplete, never got beyond the doors of the Institute.
    </p>
    <p>
      There still remains, then, more especially as regards the south, to open
      up the lode of this mine of gold,&mdash;a virgin mine as yet, inasmuch as
      Sainte-Palaye, Rochegude, Raynouard, and Fauriel, have but scraped Upon
      its surface,&mdash;and reanimate, in a poetic point of view, the middle
      ages, too easily sacrificed at the period of the <i>renaissance</i>, too
      severely proscribed by the University. Fed, in truth, from our entry into
      college with the literature of Greece and Rome, which, however admirable
      in form, is but sober in invention, we can have no conception of those
      works wherein the imagination of France, youthful, vigorous, and gay,
      blossomed in full freshness like a rose in spring. Some judgment may be
      formed of the value of the poems rhymed by the troubadours in the twelfth
      and thirteenth centuries by the romance which is now presented to the
      public. Dragged from the dust beneath which it has lain buried for six
      hundred years, the romance of <i>Jaufry</i> is translated for the first
      time; and when we consider the merit of the story, we may add, without
      fear of contradiction, that it deserved such honour long ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let the reader call up in his mind a pavilion of Smyrna or Granada, with
      columns of white marble light and graceful as those of the Alhambra, with
      elegant trellis-work, glass of varied hues, and filled with a pervading
      tone of warmth,&mdash;the warmth of a May sun,&mdash;and he will have some
      notion of the romance of <i>Jaufry and the fair Brunissende</i>:&mdash;few
      things being more piquant, more fresh, more fanciful, or which better
      reflect the charming caprices of a southern imagination in the middle
      ages. Feudal society revives therein entire, with all its fairy doings,
      its knightly fictions, its manners, and its grand lance-thrusts; and such
      is the interest of the tale, that we allow ourselves to be carried away by
      it with as much pleasure as our ancestors must have felt, when it was told
      to the sounds of the minstrers viol in the great castle-hall, or beneath
      the shadow of the tent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two peculiarities, which are not matter of indifference to history,
      enhance the value of this poetic gem: one is, the influence of Arabic
      ideas, of which it has a distant savour like the balmy oases of the East;
      and the other, the inspiration which it evidently lent to Cervantes. If,
      for instance, we discover therein the roc, the wishes, and the tent of the
      Fairy Paribanou, as traces of the <i>Arabian Nights</i>, we behold, on the
      other hand, that this romance of <i>Jaufry</i> has furnished the
      one-handed genius of Alcala with the first idea of the adventure of the
      galley-slaves (<i>desdichados galeotes</i>), the cavalier in green (<i>cavallero
      del verde gavan</i>), the braying of the regidors (<i>rebuzno de los dos
      regidores</i>), the Princess Micomicona, and the enchanted head. And in
      this respect we may be permitted to remark, that the romance of <i>Jaufry</i>
      offers matter of a piquant comparison with the work of Miguel Cervantes.
      Is it not strange, after the ingenious <i>Don Quixote</i>, to find
      ourselves reading with pleasure the adventures of a knight-errant?
    </p>
    <p>
      We should still have much to say concerning this poem and our system of
      translating it; but as we are averse to useless dissertations, we will
      confine our further remarks within short space. This romance, which is
      written in the <i>Provençal</i> tongue of the twelfth century, is composed
      of eleven thousand one hundred and sixty verses of eight syllables. * It
      was begun by a troubadour, who heard the tale related at the court of the
      king of Aragon, and finished by a poet whose modesty caused him to conceal
      his own name and that of his colleague. In order to render the reading of
      their work more pleasant, while using our efforts to retain the southern
      character and genuine tone of colour, we have pared away some of the
      verbosity and tautologies which at times encumber while they retard the
      progress of the action. May this flower of the genius of our fathers
      retain in our modern tongue a part of that freshness and perfume which
      were its attributes in former days!

     * The Imperial Library possesses two manuscript copies: one
     in small folio, written in a minute round Italian hand, with
     double columns of forty-five verses,&mdash;124 pages, classed

     quarto, which will be found under No. 7988.

    <h2>
      AUTHOR'S PREFACE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Now of a tale of chivalry, of proper fashion, great allurement, full
      of-wise and courteous instances, and wherein abound acts of great prowess,
      strange adventures, assaults, encounters, and dread battles, you may list
      the telling. An it amuse you, I will relate thereof all that I do know, or
      that it please you to give ear unto. Let me know only that which ye
      desire, and if ye be inclined to listen in good sooth. When the minstrel
      doth indeed recite, neither should hearers buy nor sell, nor in low voice
      hold council; for thus the recital is lost to him who speaketh, and they
      methinks who listen cannot find therein great pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      I come, then, to recount to you tidings of the court of good King Arthur;
      he who was so worthy, so valiant, and so wise, that his name shall never
      die, but whereof shall eternally be spoken the mighty things he did; and
      the good knights, all for their prowess known, whom he did gather at his
      famed Round Table. In that court, the fairest and most loyal that ever
      shone beneath the stars, all men did find that counsel and that aid of
      which they stood in need. There triumphed right, and there were wrongs
      redressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      There dames and damsels, widows and orphans attacked unjustly, or
      disinherited by force, ne'er failed to meet with champions. The oppressed
      of all conditions there did find a refuge, and none e'er sought protection
      there in vain. Give, then, sweet welcome to a poem the fruit of such good
      place, and deign to listen unto it in peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The troubadour who rhymed it never knew King Arthur; but he heard the
      entire story told at the court of the king of Aragon, the best of monarchs
      in this world. *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Don Pedro III., killed in 1213 at the battle of Muret.
</pre>
    <p>
      A worthy father and a famous son, lord of goodly fortunes, humble in
      heart, and frank in nature as in mind, the king of Aragon loveth God and
      feareth Him; he maintaineth faith and loyalty, peace and justice: thus God
      protecteth him, giveth him the victory when he raiseth his banner against
      the infidel, and placeth him above all those who are alike worthy and
      bold. Where shall we seek youthful brows wearing a crown which emitteth
      rays of greater splendour?
    </p>
    <p>
      He giveth good gifts to minstrels and to knights, and his court is the
      resort of all those who are esteemed brave and courteous. It was before
      him the troubadour heard related, by a stranger-knight of kin to Arthur
      and Sir Gawain, the song he here hath rhymed; and whereof the first
      adventure occurred while the king of the Round Table held his court at
      Carlisle on the day of Pentecost.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. THE ADVENTURE OF THE FOREST.
    </h2>
    <p>
      'Twas <span class="pagenum"><a name="link017" id="link017"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p017.jpg">017</a></span>on the day of Pentecost, a feast
      which to Carlisle had drawn a host of knights, that Arthur, King of
      Briton's isle, his crown placed on his brows, and to the old monastic
      church proceeded to hear mass. And with him went a brilliant train, the
      Knights of the Round Table. There were Sir Gawain, Lancelot du Lac,
      Tristrem, and Ivan bold, Eric frank of heart, and Quex the seneschal,
      Percival and Calogrant, Cliges the worthy, Coedis the handsome knight, and
      Caravis short i' the arm; the whole of his bright court, indeed, was
      there, and many more whose names I have forgot.
    </p>
    <p>
      When mass was done, they to the palace home returned 'mid laughter and
      loud noise, the thoughts of each on pleasure only bent. Each on arrival
      gave his humour play. Some spoke of love, and some of chivalry; <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link018" id="link018"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p018.jpg">018</a></span>and some of ventures they were
      going to seek. Quex at this moment came into the hall, holding a branch of
      apple in his hand. All made room for him; for there were few who did not
      fear his tongue and the hard words which it was wont to utter. This baron
      bold held nothing in respect. E'en of the best he ever said the worst. But
      this apart, he was a brave stout knight, in council sage, a valiant man of
      war, and lord of lineage high; but this, his humour and his biting words
      took from him much that was of right his due.
    </p>
    <p>
      He, going straightway to the king, thus said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, an it please you, it is time to dine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quex,&rdquo; replied Arthur, in an angry tone, &ldquo;sure thou wast born but to
      awake my wrath, and out of season ever to discourse. Have I not told thee,
      ay, a thousand times, naught should induce me to partake of food, when
      thus my court had met, till some adventure had turned up, some knight were
      vanquished, or some maid set free. Go sit thee down at bottom of the
      hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Quex went without a word among that joyous throng, where men of all
      conditions, knights and lords, minstrels and mountebanks, ceased not their
      tricks, their <span class="pagenum"><a name="link019" id="link019"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p019.jpg">019</a></span>gay discourse, their laughter, till
      the hour of noon. At noon, King Arthur called Sir Gawain, and thus spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fair nephew, cause our chargers to be brought; for since adventure cometh
      not to us, we must fain seek it in the open field; for should we longer
      stay, our knights, indeed, would have a right to think that it were time
      to dine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your will, my lord,&rdquo; Sir Gawain said, &ldquo;shall be obeyed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And at the instant he the squires bade to saddle horses and their armour
      bring. Soon were the steeds prepared, the nobles armed. The king then
      girded on his famous sword, and at the head of his bold barons placed, set
      out for Bressiland, a gloomy wood. Having along its deep and shady paths
      awhile proceeded, the good king drew rein, and 'mid the greatest silence
      bent his ear. A distant voice was then distinctly heard, calling at
      intervals for human help, and turn by turn invoking God and saints!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will ride yonder,&rdquo; bold King Arthur cried; &ldquo;but with no company save my
      good sword.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An it please you, my lord,&rdquo; Sir Gawain said, &ldquo;I fain would ride with
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not <span class="pagenum"><a name="link020" id="link020"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p020.jpg">020</a></span>so, fair nephew,&rdquo; the king made
      reply; &ldquo;I need no company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since such your wish,&rdquo; said Gawain, &ldquo;have your will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur called quickly for his shield and lance, and spurred right eagerly
      towards the spot whence came the plaintive voice. As he drew near, the
      cries the sharper grew. The king pricked on with greater speed, and
      stopped before a stream by which a mill was placed. Just at the door he
      saw a woman stand, who wept, and screamed, and wrung her trembling hands,
      while she her tresses tore in deep despair. The good king, moved to pity,
      asked her why she grieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; she weepingly replied, &ldquo;oh! help me, in God's name! a dreadful
      beast, come down from yonder mount, is there within devouring all my
      corn!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur approached, and saw the savage beast, which truly was most
      frightful to behold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Larger than largest bull, it had a coat of long and russet fur, a whitish
      neck and head, which bristled with a pile of horns. Its eyes were large
      and round, its teeth of monstrous size; its jaws were shapeless, legs of
      massive build; its feet were broad and square. A giant elk were not of
      greater bulk. Arthur observed <span class="pagenum"><a name="link021"       id="link021"></a><a href="../44433-page-images/p021.jpg">021</a></span>it for a
      certain time with wonder in his mind; crossing himself, he then got off
      his horse, drew forth his sword, and, covered with his shield, went
      straight into the mill. The beast, however, far from being scared, did not
      so much as even raise its head, but from the hopper still devoured the
      corn. Seeing it motionless, the king believed the beast was lack of
      spirit, and, to excite it, struck it on the back: but still the creature
      moved not. He then advanced, and standing right in front, lunged at the
      beast as though to run it through. It did not even seem to note the act.
      Arthur then cautiously laid down his shield, replaced his sword, and,
      being stout and strong, he seized it by the horns, and shook it with great
      force; natheless he could not make it leave the grain. In rage, he was
      about to raise his fist, so as to deal it on the head a blow; but lo! he
      could not then remove his hands,&mdash;they were as riveted unto its
      horns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon as the beast perceived its foe was caught, it raised its head; and
      issued from the mill, bearing, pendant from its horns, the king, aghast,
      distracted, and yet wild with rage. It then regained the wood at easy
      pace; when Gawain, who, by good fortune, happed to ride before his Mends,
      beheld it thus his uncle <span class="pagenum"><a name="link022"       id="link022"></a><a href="../44433-page-images/p022.jpg">022</a></span>carrying off,&mdash;a
      sight which half-deprived him of his wits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knights!&rdquo; he exclaimed aloud, &ldquo;hie hither! help to our good lord! and may
      the laggard never sit at his Round Table more! We should indeed deserve
      dishonoured names were the king lost for want of timely aid.&rdquo; As thus he
      spoke, he flew towards the beast, not waiting for the rest, and couched
      his lance as though to strike at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the king, fearing harm would come to him, addressed him thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fair nephew, thanks; but e'en for my sake halt. If thou do touch it, I am
      surely lost; and if thou spare it, saved. I might have slain it, and yet
      did not so; something now tells me I held not my hand in vain. Let it,
      then, go its course; and keep my men from coming on too near.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; Sir Gawain answered him with tears, &ldquo;must I, then, let you
      perish without help?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best of help,&rdquo; the king rejoined, &ldquo;will be to do my bidding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Gawain was at this so much incensed, he cast down lance and shield, he
      tore his cloak and handfuls from his hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just <span class="pagenum"><a name="link023" id="link023"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p023.jpg">023</a></span>at this time Ivan and Tristrem
      came, with lances lowered, and at top of speed; Gawain threw up his hands,
      and loudly cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strike not, my lords, for his, King Arthur's sake; he's a dead man if you
      but touch the beast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, then, are we to do?&rdquo; inquired they.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll follow it,&rdquo; quoth Gawain: &ldquo;if the king be hurt, the beast shall
      die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The monster still kept on its even way, not seeming to remark the knights,
      until a rock it reached, lofty and round and high. It scaled it, as a
      swallow, rapidly; and Gawain and his friends, who at a distance followed,
      sad and full of thought, saw it, when thus the summit was attained, crawl
      straight towards a peak which overhung. There, stretching out its head, it
      held the king suspended o'er the abyss. Judge the alarm of Gawain and his
      friends, who each beside was almost wild with rage! Hearing their cries,
      they who remained behind came up full spur, and reached the lofty rock,
      where, at the summit, they beheld the king hanging thus helpless from the
      monster's horns. They then gave loose to the most doleful cries that ever
      had been heard. I cannot picture to you their despair. Brave knights and
      pages then you might have <span class="pagenum"><a name="link024"       id="link024"></a><a href="../44433-page-images/p024.jpg">024</a></span>seen tearing
      their hair and rending their attire, that wood reviling and the strange
      adventure which they had come to seek. And Quex exclaimed, by way of final
      stroke:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! fair chivalry, how hard thy lot! this day to cause the death of our
      good king, and lose thy valour when 'twas needed most!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Saying these words he sank upon the ground. The king, however, still
      remained suspended in mid air, the beast meanwhile not offering to stir.
      The monarch feared to drop in that abyss; and in low voice he prayed the
      saints and God to save him from this pass. Then Gawain, Tristrem, and I
      know not who beside, took counsel how they might heap up their robes, so
      as to break the brave King Arthur's fall. Gawain had scarce proposed it to
      the crowd than each one doffed his garments speedily.
    </p>
    <p>
      In haste they brought their cloaks and mantles gay; stripped off with
      eagerness their doublets, hose; and in an instant every knight was bare:
      such was the heap of garments 'neath that rock, the king had fallen
      without deadly risk. When this the beast beheld, it stirred as though it
      would draw back, and slightly shook its head. The crowd below, alarmed, at
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="link025" id="link025"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p025.jpg">025</a></span>once upraised a cry; and on their
      bended knees prayed Heaven to guard the king, and bear him safe and sound.
      The beast with mighty spring then leaped below; and setting Arthur free,
      itself it changed into a handsome knight, in scarlet richly dad from head
      to heel. This noble bent his knee before the king, and smiling said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My liege, command your men their garments to resume; they now may dine in
      peace; though somewhat late, the adventure has been found.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur amazed, nay, half-distraught at this adventure strange, now
      recognised the knight,&mdash;a courtly guest, esteemed among the brave,
      the courteous, and the sage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adroit in arms, gay, graceful, and beloved; among the first in strife, yet
      kind and modest too,&mdash;this lord was master of the seven arts, and in
      all spells was versed. For some time past between him and the king a
      compact stood, whereby it was agreed, if he himself transformed when all
      the court was met, he should as guerdon three good gifts receive&mdash;a
      cup of gold, a charger of great price, and from the fairest damsel a sweet
      kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gawain at once ran up, fearing his uncle in his fell <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link026" id="link026"></a><a href="../44433-page-images/p026.jpg">026</a></span>was
      crushed; and you may safely judge of his surprise&mdash;finding him thus,
      in high good humour, stand loud laughing with the beast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In faith, fair friend,&rdquo; quoth he, &ldquo;you can indeed enchant poor folks, and
      force even barons to throw off their clothes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may resume them, good my lord,&rdquo; said the enchanter in the same gay
      tone; &ldquo;for lo! the king no longer needs their use.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They did indeed soon put them on again, nor stayed to pick or choose; the
      court at once returned to fair Carlisle, the monarch and Sir Gawain riding
      on a-head. The palace-walls soon echoed with their joy. The pages brought
      them wherewithal to wash, and soon the knights were placed about the
      board. Grand was that court, and rich and brave and good; many a puissant
      name, full many a king, and many a duke and count, were seated there.
      Gawain the valiant knight and Ivan the well-bred, each holding the queen's
      arm, then led her in, where, at the table, sat she 'neath the king. Gawain
      then placed himself the other side, and Ivan by the queen: at once with
      laughter they began to tell of the enchanter's skill; and when Queen
      Guenever, and they, the knights who were <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link027" id="link027"></a><a href="../44433-page-images/p027.jpg">027</a></span>not
      in the wood, had learned the doings there, they were indeed surprised; and
      soon loud laughed and chatted with the rest. Meanwhile Sir Quex before the
      king and fair Queen Ghieneyer the golden dishes placed; he then sat down
      to eat his own good meal, for he did boast a famous appetite, while ready
      pages served the other knights. Nothing was wanting at that banquet high:
      the roebuck, kid, and succulent wild-boar; the crane, the bustard, capons,
      swans, wild-geese; peacocks, and fine fat hens and partridges; white bread
      and purest wine,&mdash;of all good things the best was there beheld.
      Served by a host of graceful youths beside, the guests did honour to the
      feast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eating and drinking then engaged each thought; when straight there
      entered, mounting a fleet horse, with spotted robe, a youthful squire,
      tall and of noble mien. Never, do I believe, was man more finely-shaped.
      His shoulders were at least two cubits broad, his features regular, his
      eyes were sparkling, full of love and mirth; his hair was shining as the
      brightest gold, his arms were large and square, his teeth as ivory white.
      His frame, which tapered at the waist, was well developed, and displayed
      his strength. His legs were long and straight, and feet high-arched.
    </p>
    <p>
      His <span class="pagenum"><a name="link028" id="link028"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p028.jpg">028</a></span>violet and well-cut robe rested in
      graceful folds on hose of the same hue. A garland of fresh flowers crowned
      his brows, to which the sun had given a deeper tint, heightening the
      colour of his ruddy cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Entering the hall, he alighted from his horse, and came with quick and
      joyous step to kneel at the good monarch's feet. He then his purpose
      opened with these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May He who made this world and all it holds; He who no suzerain hath,&mdash;now
      save the king, and all that 's his!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friend,&rdquo; replied Arthur, &ldquo;thank thee for those words; if thou dost seek a
      boon, it shall be thine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My liege, I am a squire, come from far unto your court, because I knew so
      doing I should meet the best of kings; and I conjure you for St. Mary's
      sake, if you so please, to arm me now a knight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friend,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;arise, and take thy seat; it shall be done thee
      even as thou wilt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, my liege, if you permit, will I uprise from hence till you have
      granted me the boon I ask.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is conceded,&rdquo; then exclaimed the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire arose as these fair words were said, and went <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link029" id="link029"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p029.jpg">029</a></span>to take his place at that rich
      board. But scarcely was this done, than lo! the guests beheld a knight,
      well armed, and on a charger fleet, come riding in. Crossing the hall, he
      with his lance did strike a lord upon the breast, and stretched him dying
      just before the queen. He then rode out, exclaiming as he went:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This have I done to shame thee, wicked king. If it do grieve thee, and
      thy boasted knights should care to follow, I am Taulat Lord of Rugimon;
      and each passing year, on this same day, will I return to do thee the like
      scorn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Good Arthur drooped his head, enraged, yet sad; but then the squire rose,
      and knelt before the king:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;now give me knightly arms, that I may follow up that
      haughty lord who casts dishonour on this royal court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friend,&rdquo; exclaimed Quex at this, &ldquo;your courage will be higher when you're
      drunk. Sit yourself down again, and drink another bout; the heart will be
      the merrier, and you can better floor a knight with wine than with a
      sharp-edged sword, however stout!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The squire to this responded not a word, out of his duty for the worthy
      king; but for such cause, Quex had <span class="pagenum"><a name="link030"       id="link030"></a><a href="../44433-page-images/p030.jpg">030</a></span>for his speech
      paid dear. Arthur, however, gave his anger vent, and thus exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wilt thou, then, Quex, ne'er hold that biting tongue until I've driven
      thee from out my court? What has emboldened thee to speak thus vilely, and
      to a stranger who a suit prefers? Canst thou not keep within thee all the
      spite, the envy, wicked words, and slanderous thoughts with which thou art
      swelling o'er?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; the squire said, &ldquo;pray let him have his say; little heed I the
      flings of his forked tongue, for which I will a noble vengeance seek. Vile
      word ne'er sullieth honour. Let me rather have a suit of arms, to follow
      him who now has issued hence; for I do feel I shall not eat at ease till
      he and I have met in deadly fight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The monarch courteously replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend, I willingly will give thee steed, good arms, and knightly
      spurs; for thou dost ask these gifts as squire of gentle birth. But thou
      art all too young to fight with him who now has left this hall. Not four
      among the knights of my Hound Table can dare to meet his blows, or touch
      him in the field. Leave, then, this care to others; I should grieve to
      lose at once so stout and brave a squire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since, <span class="pagenum"><a name="link031" id="link031"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p031.jpg">031</a></span>sire, you think me stout, and call
      me brave, 'tis wrongfully or but to jeer you wish to stay my fighting; but
      in that you'll not succeed save you refuse to grant the boon erewhile you
      promised me;&mdash;and should a king forget his promise made, gone are his
      lustre and his courtesy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The monarch answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friend, I yield me to thy ardent wish; thou shalt be armed a knight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then commanded two attendant squires at once go seek his armour, lance,
      a fine and tempered shield, the casque, the sharp-edged sword, the spurs,
      and horse of price in full caparison; then, when they brought the arms and
      horse, he caused the squire to put the hauberk on, he buckled his right
      spur, girded his sword upon the youth's left flank, and having kissed him
      gently on the mouth, he asked of him his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, in the land where I was born my name is Jaufry, son of Dovon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king, on hearing him speak thus, sighed heavily, and said, while tears
      were in his eye:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! what a knight and lord of mark was this same Dovon! He was of my
      table and my court. A <span class="pagenum"><a name="link032" id="link032"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p032.jpg">032</a></span>brave knight and a learned: never
      had he superior in arms. None were held stouter or more dread in fight.
      May God, if He so will it, grant him grace; since for my sake he died! An
      archer pierced his heart with a steel bolt, while he a keep held out on my
      domain in Normandy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile a squire brought Jaufry a bay steed. The young knight placed his
      hand upon the bow, and leaped upon the horse, all armed as he then stood,
      without the use of stirrup; then called he for his shield and lance,
      consigned the king to God, and having taken leave of all the rest, he
      galloped from that hall.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. ESTOUT DE VERFEIL.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The <span class="pagenum"><a name="link033" id="link033"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p033.jpg">033</a></span>charger, which was fleet and fair
      to view, started off like an arrow from its bow. So that, as Jaufry left
      the castle-gates, he hoped he yet should overtake the knight; and
      therefore cried aloud to two men on the way:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good fellows, if you can, tell me the road just taken by the lord who
      left the castle yonder even now. If naught prevent you, point me out the
      way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One of those men replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak you of him whose armour was so bright?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same,&rdquo; quoth Jaufry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is on before; you start too late, sir knight, to catch him up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Heaven!&rdquo; murmured Jaufry, much aggrieved, &ldquo;he cannot flee so far, or
      sink so deep, but I will reach <span class="pagenum"><a name="link034"       id="link034"></a><a href="../44433-page-images/p034.jpg">034</a></span>him. I'll seek
      him the world through, where land and sea are found, and will discover his
      retreat even beneath the earth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This said, he held his course; and spurring, came to a broad causeway
      where fresh prints of horses' hoofs appeared upon the dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Methinks,&rdquo; said Jaufry, &ldquo;that a knight ere-while hath passed this way: so
      I will follow up this selfsame road while thus the trail is seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Putting his horse into an ambling pace, he rode on all that day without a
      town or castle being met. At eventide he still continued on, when a loud
      cry, followed by din of arms and clash of steel on helm, suddenly rose
      from out the heavy shade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jaufry spurred readily towards the spot, and cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are ye, lords, who at this hour do fight? Reply, since eyes of man
      cannot behold you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But no one replied; and when, as fits a bold and venturous man, he reached
      the place whence came the clashing noise, the fight was over and the din
      had ceased. Whilst then he listened, seeing naught, and at the silence
      wondering, there rose from out the shade deep sighs and moans; when,
      stooping forward, he made out <span class="pagenum"><a name="link035"       id="link035"></a><a href="../44433-page-images/p035.jpg">035</a></span>a knight so
      sadly hurt the soil was bathed in blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knight,&rdquo; cried Jaufry to the corpse, &ldquo;it grieves me not to know thy
      slayer, or whether thou wert wrong or whether right: thou art now dead;
      but if I can, I even will learn why, and by whose hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knight,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;speak, and inform me for what, and by whom, thou
      hast been so sorely used.&rdquo; The wounded man could not e'en stir his lips or
      move a limb; his arms grew stiff; and, with two fearful groans, he yielded
      up the ghost.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Knight,&rdquo; then cried Jaufry to the corpse, &ldquo;it grieves me not to know thy
      slayer, or whether thou wert wrong or whether right: thou now art dead;
      but if I can, I even will learn why and by whose hand.&rdquo; He then departed,
      and resumed his way, now on the trot and now at ambling pace, stopping at
      intervals to bend his ear and give a look around. For some time nothing
      met his ear or eye; but, after having ridden for a space, a noise of
      battle once again assailed him. Steel, wood, and iron met with such dread
      force, it seemed as though the thunder vexed the air, and that this din
      proclaimed the bursting storm. At once, then, to the side from whence it
      came Sir Jaufry turned his horse; and, with his shield about his neck, his
      lance in rest prepared, he spurred with ardour on, for, in his mood, it
      seemed as though he ne'er should learn who slew the knight and who were
      they that fought. On, then, to <span class="pagenum"><a name="link036"       id="link036"></a><a href="../44433-page-images/p036.jpg">036</a></span>that affray he
      hotly came; but to behold, stretched stiff upon the ground, a knight all
      armed, whose casque and head beside had by a single blow been cloven to
      the teeth, while his steel hauberk was all red with gore. Jaufry his visor
      raised, and touched him with his lance; but, seeing no life was there,
      exclaimed with grief:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven! shall I, then, never know whose hand hath slain these knights?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Full of impatience he resumed his course; and when he far had ridden, lit
      upon another knight, whose body was so shattered with his hurts that blood
      and life were oozing fast away. Moved deeply at his cries and sad laments,
      Jaufry drew near, and kindly asked what hand had dealt such measure to
      himself and the two others slain, and which side was moreover in the
      wrong?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; the wounded man made answer with a sigh, &ldquo;I will explain to you
      the simple truth. It is Estout, the master of Verfeil, who has reduced us
      to the state you see, to feed his pride. This knight is known so
      quarrelsome and fierce, that without mercy and without a cause he doth
      assault all comers far and near.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell <span class="pagenum"><a name="link037" id="link037"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p037.jpg">037</a></span>me,&rdquo; said Jaufry, &ldquo;was he wrong in
      this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, my lord, with Heaven's help, and that without e'en lying by a
      word. I and my friends were going to our rest, when Estout to my
      castle-gates, hard by, rode up, and bade us high defiance. Had it been
      day, we should have tarried long ere venturing forth; for we did know him
      master of such skill, that few as yet could e'er make head against him,&mdash;so
      merciless beside, as never in his lifetime ever known to grant his foeman
      grace: seeing him not, the bridge was lowered, and at once was passed. He,
      having drawn us far upon the road,&mdash;the better for the treacherous
      ends he had,&mdash;suddenly stopped, and turning, with lance couched on
      him who pressed him nearest, stretched him dead upon the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By this time we had recognised Estout, and turned our horses' heads; but
      he with threatening words pursued us close, and reaching my companion,
      slew him with a blow. He then his rage concentrated on me, and with such
      fierceness, thinking my end come, I missed my aim, the lance just glancing
      from his shield; but he with one stroke bore me from my horse, and three
      times struck me as I helpless lay, so that, <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link038" id="link038"></a><a href="../44433-page-images/p038.jpg">038</a></span>good
      faith, he little life hath left. This, my good lord, is how the thing hath
      happed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Know you,&rdquo; asked Jaufry, full of thought, &ldquo;the road he took, and where he
      may be met?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord, I cannot tell; but little do I doubt that you will find him
      earlier than you wish. Haste, then, to fly such presence; for believe, you
      cannot gain thereby aught else but iron: an you take my advice, you'll
      change your route.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Change my route, say ye?&rdquo; quoth Sir Jaufry; &ldquo;no, by my troth; nay more, I
      will but follow him the closer up; and, should I catch this lord, we part
      not, he may rest assured, without a struggle; and without learning, too,
      which of us twain doth bear the stouter heart, the stronger arm, or wield
      the better sword.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took his leave, with these words, of the knight; the latter prayed him
      to pass by his keep and send him aid from thence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not fail,&rdquo; said Jaufry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards the manor of the dying man he took his way, and after some brief
      space he saw high towers and two squires well armed, who mounted guard
      before a raised drawbridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friends,&rdquo; <span class="pagenum"><a name="link039" id="link039"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p039.jpg">039</a></span>he exclaimed to them, &ldquo;God save you
      both!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, my lord, from every harm,&rdquo; they said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have sad message for you,&rdquo; added Jaufry, &ldquo;and bad news. Your lord is
      lying yonder sorely hurt; and his two comrades are both slain. Estout de
      Verfeil has misused them thus. So hasten to your lord, who wants your
      help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then commended them to God, and parted in all haste. Jaufry resumed his
      way, now trotting hard and now at ambling pace, until he reached a valley
      deep and dark. There he beheld the blaze of a great fire, round which were
      met a numerous company. Trusting he might get tidings there of Estout and
      of Taulat,&mdash;for truly counted he on fighting both,&mdash;he
      straightway rode to where the fire was, and found there figures that
      awaked surprise. Lords in rich vestments roasted a wild-boar; meanwhile,
      by dwarfs, stunted and out of shape, the spit was turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good sirs,&rdquo; said Jaufry civilly, &ldquo;could I but learn from some of you
      where I may meet a lord I have followed this night through?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friend,&rdquo; exclaimed one in answer, &ldquo;it may be we can tell you when we know
      his name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <span class="pagenum"><a name="link040" id="link040"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p040.jpg">040</a></span>seek,&rdquo; said Jaufry, &ldquo;Estout de
      Verfeil, and Taulat called the Lord of Rugimon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friend,&rdquo; said the knight with courtesy, &ldquo;from hence depart, and that with
      greatest speed; for should Estout but chance to meet you here thus armed,
      I would not give a denier for your life. He is so valiant and so stout of
      limb, that never yet hath he encountered foe who could make head against
      him. All these you see around are knights of proof, and can meet sturdy
      blows; natheless he hath subdued us all, and we are forced to follow him
      on foot wherever choice or venture leads him on. We're now engaged
      preparing him his food; so I advise you to depart at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so, indeed,&rdquo; said Jaufry; &ldquo;I came not here to flee. Before I turn my
      face, my shield shall be destroyed, my hauberk riven, and my arm so
      bruised it cannot wield a blade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whilst thus they held discourse, behold Estout arrived full spur, and, at
      the sight of Jaufry, cried aloud: &ldquo;Who art thou, vassal, who thus dar'st
      to come and meddle with my men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who are you,&rdquo; said Jaufry in reply, &ldquo;who use such pleasant words?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou shalt know that anon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are <span class="pagenum"><a name="link041" id="link041"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p041.jpg">041</a></span>you Estout?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am, indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Full long have I been seeking you throughout this weary night, without
      e'er stopping in my course or closing eye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And for what end hast thou thus sought me out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For that I wish to know why thou hast slain the three knights on the
      road; which act I take to be a sin and wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is it for this that thou art hither come? Thou wouldst have better
      done to stay behind, for to thy ruin do I meet thee here; thou shalt this
      instant lose that head of thine, or follow me on foot like yonder knights
      who patter humbly at my horse's heels. Deliver, therefore, up to me thy
      shield, thy breastplate, and thy sword, and the bay horse that brought thy
      body here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My care shall be to guard them with my life,&rdquo; quoth Jaufry. &ldquo;'Twas the
      good king bestowed this courser on me when he armed me knight. As to the
      shield, thou shalt not have it whole; nor e'en the hauberk, without rent
      or stain. Thou tak'st me for a child, whom thy poor threats can frighten:
      the shield, the hauberk, and the horse, are not yet thine; but if they
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="link042" id="link042"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p042.jpg">042</a></span>please thee, try a bout to win
      them. As to thy threats, I scorn them: 'threats,' saith the proverb,
      'often cover fear.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Estout drew off his horse at these bold words, and Jaufry nerved him to
      sustain the shock; then ran they at each other with their utmost speed.
      Estout struck Jaufry on the shield's bright boss, and with such mighty
      strength, that through the riven metal went the lance, breaking the mail
      which guarded his broad chest, and grazing e'en the skin. Jaufry meanwhile
      had struck his foe in turn, and with so just an aim, he lost at once his
      stirrups and his seat, and rolled halfstunned upon the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose again full quickly, pale with rage, and came with upraised sword
      towards Jaufry. The latter, wishing his good horse to spare, at once leapt
      on the sod and raised his shield. 'Twas just in time: Estout, in his
      fierce rage, brandished his sword with both his hands, and made it thunder
      down with such effect the shield was cloven to the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;St. Peter!&rdquo; murmured Jaufry, &ldquo;thou dost covet this poor shield; still, if
      naught stay me, it shall cost thee dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suiting to such words the act, upon Estout's bright casque <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link043" id="link043"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p043.jpg">043</a></span>he then let fly so fierce a
      downward stroke, that fire issued therefrom. But the good helm of proof
      was not a whit the worse. With gathering fury Estout came again, and with
      one stroke pared from Sir Jaufry's shield the double rim, full half a palm
      of mail, and the left spur, which was cut through as the blade reached the
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wondering at the vigour of his dreadful foe, Jaufry, on his side, struck a
      second time his burnished helm; and with such force, his sword in twain
      was broken, yet left it not upon the trusty steel even the slightest dent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven!&rdquo; thought Jaufry, &ldquo;what doth this portend? confounded be the hand
      that helmet wrought, whereon my blade hath spent itself in vain!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Estout, uttering a fearful cry as he beheld Sir Jaufry's sword in
      two, flew straight towards him, and in his turn struck the son of Dovon on
      the helm, smashing the visor as the blow came down. Had he not raised in
      time the remnant of his shield, which that fell stroke for aye destroyed,
      the combat had been done.

    </h4>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knight,&rdquo; said Sir Jaufry, &ldquo;thou dost press me sore; and I, good sooth,
      must be indeed bewitched; strike <span class="pagenum"><a name="link044"       id="link044"></a><a href="../44433-page-images/p044.jpg">044</a></span>as I will upon
      that helm of thine, I cannot crack its shell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As thus he spoke, he launched a desperate blow with what was left him of
      his blade; which, falling on the casque of his stout foe like hammer on an
      anvil, for the time deprived him both of sight and sound. With dizzy eye
      and tottering step, Estout, thinking to strike at Jaufry, whom he would
      have cloven to the heel had he received the blow, let fall his sword with
      such unbounded rage, it struck into the ground, and buried half its blade.
      Before he could withdraw it, the young knight, casting aside the battered
      shield and broken sword, seized with both arms Estout about the waist, and
      that with such good-will, his very ribs were heard to crack within. To
      cast him to the ground, undo his helm, and seize his sword to strike off
      his foe's head, were but an instant's work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Estout, who moved not, cried with feeble voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy, good knight! O, slay me not, but take of me such ransom as thou
      wilt; I own that thou hast vanquished me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou shalt have mercy,&rdquo; Jaufry then replied, &ldquo;an thou do'st that which I
      shall now command.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It <span class="pagenum"><a name="link045" id="link045"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p045.jpg">045</a></span>shall be done most willingly, my
      lord; thou canst not ask a thing I will not do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place,&rdquo; said Jaufry, &ldquo;thou shalt go and yield thyself a
      captive to King Arthur, with all these knights, to whom thou must restore
      what thou hast ta'en from them; and thou shalt then relate to that good
      king how I have thus o'ercome thee in the fight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do so full willingly, by Heaven!&rdquo; Estout replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Jaufry, &ldquo;give to me thine arms; for mine have been all
      hacked and hewed by thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agreed, my lord. Give me your hand: the bargain shall be kept; and well
      can I aver, without a lie, that ne'er did knight boast armour such as
      mine. Many's the blow may fall upon this helm, yet never pass it through;
      no lance can dim this shield or pierce this mail; and for this sword, so
      hard is it of temper, iron nor bronze nor steel resists its edge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jaufry then donned these valuable arms; and whilst he buckled on the
      shining helm and burnished shield and girded the good sword, the captives
      of Estout came up to do him homage. They were two score in number, all of
      price and lofty lineage, who addressed him, 'mid warm smiles of joy:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fair <span class="pagenum"><a name="link046" id="link046"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p046.jpg">046</a></span>lord, what answer will ye that we
      make when good King Arthur asks the name of him who sets us free?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will reply that Jaufry is his name,&mdash;Jaufry the son of Dovon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This said, he ordered that his horse be led; for still he burned to
      overtake Taulat. And though Estout and all the knights pressed him awhile
      to tarry, yet he stayed neither to eat nor take the least repose: from
      squires' hands receiving shield and lance, he took his leave, and wandered
      on his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day came on both clear and beautiful; a bright sun rose on fields
      humect with dew; charmed with the spring-tide and the matin hour, the
      birds sang merrily beneath the verdant shade and conned their latin notes.
      * Jaufry, natheless, went straight upon his road, still bent on finding
      Taulat; for to him nor peace nor rest nor pleasure can e'er come till that
      proud lord be met.

      CHAPTER III. THE DWARF AND THE LANCE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      After <span class="pagenum"><a name="link047" id="link047"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p047.jpg">047</a></span>Sir Jaufry had rode on his way,
      Estout his promise kept, and to each knight restored both horse and arms.
      That evening he set out for Arthur's court, which he resolved to reach
      before the jousts and games and banquetings were o'er. Eight days had they
      been holden in those halls when he arrived there with his company. 'Twas
      after dinner, as the king was seated with his lords, lending an ear to
      minstrels' tales and the discourse of knights, who told of acts of lofty
      prowess done, that Estout came with that armed troop of knights. Having
      alighted at the palace-gates, they soon were led before the worthy king;
      when, kneeling at his feet, Estout expressed himself in terms like these:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, may that high King who made and fashioned <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link048" id="link048"></a><a href="../44433-page-images/p048.jpg">048</a></span>all
      things, He, the Lord of every sovereign, who hath nor peer nor mate, now
      save us in your company!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friend,&rdquo; the king replied, &ldquo;God save you, and your friends beside! Who
      are ye, and what come ye here to seek?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord, I will recount you the whole truth: from Jaufry, son of Dovon,
      come we, to proclaim ourselves your captives, and submit to your just law.
      Sir Jaufry hath delivered all these knights, whom I had captured one by
      one, and who were bound to follow me on foot,&mdash;for they had mercy
      only on such terms; now he hath conquered me by force of arms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when thou last beheldst him,&rdquo; asked the king, &ldquo;by that true faith
      thou ow'st to gracious Heaven, say, was he well in health?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yea, sire, by the troth I owe to you, believe, that eight days since,
      arise to-morrow's sun, I left him sound, robust, and full of fire. He
      would not even tarry to break bread; for he declared no food should pass
      his lips, no joy, no pleasure, no repose be his, until the knight named
      Taulat he had found. He now is on his track; and I engage, that if he meet
      him, and a chance do get to measure sword with sword, it will be strange
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="link049" id="link049"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p049.jpg">049</a></span>an he not force him to cry grace;
      for I do not believe the world doth own a braver knight, or one more
      strong in arms. I speak from proof, who dearly know his force.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Heaven, in which I trust,&rdquo; cried Arthur, as he clasped his hands,
      &ldquo;grant me my prayer, that Jaufry fry safe and sound may back return!
      Already is he known a doughty knight, and noble are the gifts he hither
      sends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leave we now bold Estout to tell his tale, and turn we to our knight. I
      have related how Sir Jaufry still went on seeking his foe by valley and by
      mount; yet neither spied nor heard he living man to give him tidings. He
      rode on thus, nor met he man or beast till the high noon was passed. The
      sun had now become intensely hot, and hardly could he bear its burning
      ray; still, neither sun, nor hunger, thirst, nor aught beside, could cow
      his spirit. Determined not to stop upon his road till he had Taulat met,
      he still progressed, though ne'er a soul was seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he pressed hotly on, some hours' riding found the youthful knight close
      by a gentle hill shaded by one of nature's finest trees. Pendent there
      hung from an outstretching bough a fair white lance of ash with point
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="link050" id="link050"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p050.jpg">050</a></span>of burnished steel. Thinking a
      knight perchance was resting near, Jaufry in that direction turned his
      horse, and galloped towards the spot. When he had reached the bottom of
      the hill, he nimbly leapt him down, and walked to the high tree; but, to
      his great surprise, no soul was there, naught save the lance suspended to
      the bough. With wonder then&mdash;asking of himself why arm so stout and
      good, the point of which like virgin silver shone, should there be placed&mdash;he
      took it down, and his own resting gainst the mossy trunk, handled and
      brandished this new dainty lance, which he discovered to be good as fair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good faith,&rdquo; quoth he, &ldquo;I will e'en keep this arm, and leave mine own
      behind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whilst making this exchange, a dwarf of frightful shape suddenly rushed
      from out a neighbouring grove. Stunted and broad and fat, he had a
      monstrous head, from which straight hair streamed down and crossed his
      back; long eyebrows hid his eyes; his nose was large and shapeless;
      nostrils so immense they would have held your fists; and thick and bluish
      lips rested on large and crooked fangs; a stiff moustache surrounded this
      huge mouth; and to his very girdle flowed <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link051" id="link051"></a><a href="../44433-page-images/p051.jpg">051</a></span>his
      beard; he measured scarce a foot from waist to heel; his head was sunken
      in his shoulders high; and his arms seemed so short, that useless would
      have been the attempt to bind them at his back. As to his hands, they were
      like paws of toads, so broad and webbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knight,&rdquo; cried this monster, &ldquo;woe befals the man who meddles with that
      lance! Thou wilt receive thy dues, and dangle on our tree; come, then,
      give up thy shield.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Jaufry eyed the dwarf, and angrily replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What mean you by such tale, misshapen wretch?&rdquo; At this the dwarf set up
      so loud a cry that all the vale resounded; and at once a knight well
      armed, mounted upon a steed in iron cased, came, with high threats upon
      his lips exclaiming:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Woe to the man who hath dared touch the lance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having the hill attained, he Jaufry saw; and thereupon he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Heaven, sir knight! to do what thou hast done is proof thou carest
      little for thy life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why so, lord?&rdquo; Sir Jaufry calmly asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou shalt soon learn. No man doth touch that lance <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link052" id="link052"></a><a href="../44433-page-images/p052.jpg">052</a></span>and
      get him hence without a fight with me. If I unhorse the knight so bold as
      dare to touch it, and conquer him by arms, no ransom saves his life,&mdash;I
      hang him by the neck; and on my gallows which thou seest from here full
      three-and-thirty dangle in mid air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me now faithfully,&rdquo; Sir Jaufry said,&mdash;&ldquo;can he who sues for
      mercy gain it at thy hands?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yea, but on one condition I have firmly fixed; which is, that never in
      his life he cross a horse; ne'er cut his hair or pare his nails; ne'er eat
      of wheaten bread, or taste of wine; and never on his back wear other dress
      than what his hands have woven. Should he such terms accept before the
      fight, he may perchance find grace; but naught can save the man who once
      hath fought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if he know not how to weave such dress?&rdquo; asked Jaufry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The art to weave, to shape the doth, and sew, must then be learned,&rdquo; the
      knight replied. &ldquo;Say, then, if thou consent; or if thou choose this hour
      to be thy last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll not do so,&rdquo; quoth Jaufry; &ldquo;for too hard the labour seems.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou'lt do it well before five years are fled; for thou art tall and
      strong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, <span class="pagenum"><a name="link053" id="link053"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p053.jpg">053</a></span>by my troth, I'd rather chance the
      fight, since 'twould appear I've no alternative.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take my defiance, then!&rdquo; cried out the knight; &ldquo;and bear in mind, the
      combat 's to the death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So be it!&rdquo; said Sir Jaufry; &ldquo;I'll defend myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They drew apart some space with such-like words, each thinking on his side
      a victim soon would fall. Then the knight came and thundered at his foe.
      In shivers flew the lance; but Jaufry bore the shock unmoved. Not so the
      knight; for Jaufry, his weapon planting at his shield, broke it right
      through; the hauberk too beside, and wood and iron, for a cubit's length,
      pierced through the shoulder.

      He fell: Jaufry with naked blade was by his side; but as he saw him thus,
      so poorly sped,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knight,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;methinks thy hanging-trade is done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; cried the wounded man, &ldquo;unhappily 'tis true. Thou hast too well
      performed thy work for safety henceforth to be banished hence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not trust to that,&rdquo; quoth Jaufry; &ldquo;or at least, it shan't prevent
      my hanging thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Heaven's name, my lord, I crave thy grace!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And by what claim canst thou obtain it, thou who <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link054" id="link054"></a><a href="../44433-page-images/p054.jpg">054</a></span>never
      yet hast granted it to man? Thou shalt find pity, such as those yonder
      found who once begged grace of thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If, good my lord, my head have erred, my heart been black and habits
      villanous, guard thee from following in my steps. I ask for mercy&mdash;that
      should I receive. Wilt thou, a man of lofty virtue, choose that ever the
      reproach should come to thee of hanging up a brave and courteous knight,
      such as I once did bear the title of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou liest in thy throat,&rdquo; Sir Jaufry said; &ldquo;never couldst thou be prized
      a proper knight, but rather, I believe, an arrant knave. Who doth a
      villain's act doth forfeit rank and chivalry alike. In vain thy suit; no
      pardon shalt thou find.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Undoing his steel helmet as he spoke, he seized a rope and placed it round
      his neck; then, dragging him beneath the dismal tree, he well and fairly
      hung him up thereto.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good friend,&rdquo; he then apostrophised the knight, &ldquo;the passage now may be
      considered safe, and travellers need fear little more from thee.&rdquo;

      Leaving him hanging upon such adieu, he rode towards the dwarf, as with
      intent to kill. But when the latter <span class="pagenum"><a name="link055"       id="link055"></a><a href="../44433-page-images/p055.jpg">055</a></span>saw him thus
      return, crossing his arms full quickly on his breast,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fair sir,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I yield to you and Heaven; but grant me, pray, your
      pity. Of myself no evil have I done; since, had I disobeyed the knight, I
      should have lost my life. Maugre myself, for fourteen years I've watched
      this lance, which twice a-day I burnished. Woe had betided me if I had
      bilked such task, or failed by signal to advise my lord when it was
      touched by knight. This, fair my lord, hath been my only crime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou mayst have mercy,&rdquo; Jaufry said, &ldquo;an thou dost that which I shall now
      command.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak, good my lord; and God confound me if I lose a word!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rise, then, and hie thee to King Arthur's court. Tell to that king the
      son of Dovon sends thee, and presents this lance which he hath won, the
      fairest weapon eye hath e'er beheld. Recount to him beside thy lord's
      ill-deeds, how that so many worthy knights he'd hung, and how in his turn
      like meed was given unto him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; exclaimed the dwarf, &ldquo;all this I promise you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Jaufry made reply, &ldquo;Well then, begone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It <span class="pagenum"><a name="link056" id="link056"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p056.jpg">056</a></span>was one Monday eye that this fell
      out, just at the setting sun. The night came shortly on serene and fair,
      and the full moon shone out as bright as day. Jaufry pursued his road,&mdash;for
      naught could change his purpose,&mdash;and the dwarf prepared to execute
      his trust. At peep of morn he started for Carlisle, where, after certain
      time, he safely came. The king was breaking up his court, which for two
      weeks he there had held, and knights and barons all were going their way
      content and glad, bearing rich guerdons from their noble lord, when
      curiosity their steps detained at sight of a strange dwarf, who in his
      hand a handsome lance did hold. This dwarf pushed forward to the
      palace-hall, where each with eager eye observed his shape; for never till
      that day had they beheld such wondrous man; but he, passing the gaping
      crowd without remark, straight to the monarch's throne his steps pursued;
      and there he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May God, most noble sire, grant you weal! Albeit my form is strange, yet,
      please you, hear, for I do come a messenger from far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dwarf,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;God save thee too! for thou methinks art honest.
      Speak without fear, and do thy message featly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The <span class="pagenum"><a name="link057" id="link057"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p057.jpg">057</a></span>dwarf preluded with a sigh, and
      thus began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, from Dovon's son I bear to you this lance, which has been cause of
      mourning dire and great. Proud of his valour and his strength, a knight
      had hung it to a tree upon a hill, where I have watched it, burnished it
      beside twice every day, for fourteen weary years. If a knight touched it,
      I by my cry aroused my lord, who then, all armed, would rush upon the
      stranger; being vanquished, he was quickly seized and by the neck
      incontinently hung. 'Twas thus that three-and-thirty met their fate; when
      that the knight, whose messenger I am, conquered this lord and won the
      lance, hanging in turn its owner for his deeds. This is the lance that now
      he sends to you; and here am I, your vassal and your slave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis well,&rdquo; the king replied; &ldquo;but, dwarf, now give me, on thy faith,
      some news of brave Sir Jaufry: without a lie, say when thou saw'st him
      last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Twas Monday evening, please you, my good lord; I left him when the fray
      was o'er and he had finished hanging up the knight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And was his health then good?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yea, sire, with God's help, and well disposed and gay.&rdquo;
     </p>

      &ldquo;Good <span class="pagenum"><a name="link058" id="link058"></a><a

      CHAPTER IV. THE YEOMAN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      We <span class="pagenum"><a name="link059" id="link059"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p059.jpg">059</a></span>now return to Jaufry, who still
      wanders on, resolving not to stay for food or sleep before he meets with
      Taulat; for in his ears incessantly do ring the biting words of Quex: &ldquo;<i>Your
      courage will be higher when you're drunk,</i>&rdquo;&mdash;and he yet trusts to
      prove that lord did lie by beating Taulat fasting. Onward he therefore
      pricked till midnight hour, when he attained a narrow and dark gorge shut
      in on either side by mountains high. No other passage was there but this
      one. Sir Jaufry gave his horse the spur; when, at the very mouth of the
      defile, before him stood a yeoman, active, of stout build and large of
      limb, who held within his grasp three pointed darts that were as razors
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="link060" id="link060"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p060.jpg">060</a></span>sharp. A large knife pended from
      his girdle, which enclosed an outer garment of good form and fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halt, knight,&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;I'll have a word with thee.&rdquo;

    <p>
      Jaufry drew rein, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what's thy quest, good friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou must give up thy horse and knightly arms; for upon such condition
      only mayst thou pass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; quoth Jaufry; &ldquo;dost thou mean to say an armed and mounted knight
      must not pass through this strait?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He might do so, but for the toll I've levied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the foul fiend such toll! Never will I give up my horse or arms, till
      strength's denied me to defend them both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An that thou yield'st them not with gentle grace,&rdquo; the yeoman said, &ldquo;I
      must use force to take them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And wherefore so? what harm have I e'er wrought thee?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dost thou not wish to pass this gorge, and bilk the toll that's due save
      I use force to get it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what's the force thou'lt use?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That <span class="pagenum"><a name="link061" id="link061"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p061.jpg">061</a></span>thou shalt briefly see; meantime I
      bid thee 'ware my hand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do so,&rdquo; quoth Jaufry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The yeoman now prepared himself for fight, and seized his dart as though
      in act to strike; but Jaufry, fearing for his horse, awaited not the blow,
      but gal-loped off amain. As o'er the road he sped, the man let fly the
      missile with just aim; it hit the shield, and that with force so great,
      red fire and flame forth issued at the stroke, which did not pierce it
      through. The sharpened point curled upwards on the steel, and the wood
      flew in shivers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Jaufry turned his steed at once and bore down on his foe, counting
      full surely that the fight was done; but, lo, at that instant he had leapt
      aside, and in the act discharged a second dart, which lighted on his helm;
      so fierce the stroke, the casque seemed all on fire; yet it resisted,
      though its lord was stunned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The yeoman, seeing his second blow had failed, was as a man possessed; so
      dread his rage as neither to have hurt the knight or broken his bright
      arms. Jaufry, whose senses had now back returned, thought only of his
      horse, which he rode here and there to guard it from the blow of the third
      dart. Not this, however, was his foe's <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link062" id="link062"></a><a href="../44433-page-images/p062.jpg">062</a></span>intent,
      for he still thought to take the beast alive; like lightning swift he
      came, and whirling round the dart, launched the fell weapon with these
      haughty words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Heaven, slave, thou now shalt leave the horse, nor shall thy hauberk,
      helm, or shield protect thyself!&rdquo; Jaufry wheeled round his horse at this
      stem threat; and as the dart came hissing to its prey, he deftly bowed him
      down; it harmed him not, but striking on his mail, tore from the goodly
      arms a palm away, then bounded out of view.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; cried Jaufry, the third dart being flung, &ldquo;my lance's point
      shall give me my revenge.&rdquo; With lowered lance he flew towards the man,
      trusting this time to pierce him through and through; but he was nimble as
      a roe or deer, and leapt from place to place to such effect, that Jaufry
      missed his aim; and as he passed, the yeoman seized a rock and hurled it
      at the knight, who, but for his shield, must fain have bit the ground. The
      mass in atoms flew; but such the force with which the blow was struck, it
      battered-in the shield. Jaufry, enraged at following such a foe, now
      doubly maddened at this fresh attack, in wrath exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God, <span class="pagenum"><a name="link063" id="link063"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p063.jpg">063</a></span>thou all-glorious King! how shall I
      meet this fiend? The world I'll hold not at a denier's price till he doth
      sue for grace!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then wielding his long lance,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This time,&rdquo; he loudly to the yeoman cried, &ldquo;or thou or I shall fall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The yeoman from his girdle plucked his knife, and made reply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ere that thou leave this spot thou'lt pay the toll!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, that will I,&rdquo; quoth Jaufry, &ldquo;take my promise on't; before we part,
      thou shalt have toll enough!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He once again renewed a brisk attack, but still the other dodged; and ere
      that Jaufry could draw-in the rein, with mighty spring upon the horse he
      leapt and round Sir Jaufry's body twined his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stir not, sir knight,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;unless thou wish for death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Jaufry felt himself thus rudely seized, his mind was in a maze, and
      for a time incapable of thought. The yeoman held him with such strait
      embrace he could not stir a limb, while in his ear he hissed his future
      fate: how that a prison should his <span class="pagenum"><a name="link064"       id="link064"></a> <a href="../44433-page-images/p064.jpg">060</a></span>body hold,
      where tortures, griefs, unheard-of pains, should vex him evermore. Till
      break of day his arms were round him clasped; but when the stars were
      gone, then Jaufry communed with himself and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better to die for God, who made this earth, than let my body be a
      dungeon's prey. We'll see what can be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reflecting thus, he let his lance drop down, and as the yeoman's right arm
      pressed him most with energy he clutched it in his grasp; so vigorous the
      attack, so nerved his strength, he forced the hand to loose the gleaming
      knife: then, when he saw the arm was paralysed and drooped inertly down,
      he fixed with both hands on the yeoman's left, which he then twisted till
      he caused such pain, its owner reeled in groaning to the ground.
      Dismounting from his horse, Jaufry drew near his foe, who lay quite
      motionless crying for mercy in his agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Heaven! which I adore,&rdquo; quoth Jaufry, &ldquo;ne'er will I pity show to
      wretch like thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And at the words he cut off both his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I prithee, now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;run not, nor leap, nor battle more with
      knights. Take to another trade; for far too long hath this one been thy
      choice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He <span class="pagenum"><a name="link065" id="link065"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p065.jpg">065</a></span>gathered up his lance and shield,
      and, mounting on his horse, prepared him quietly to go his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Twas on a Tuesday, early in the morn, that Jaufry held this speech; but
      as he turned him from his footless foe,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not yet inquired,&rdquo; he observed, &ldquo;if thou perchance hold'st knights
      within thy walls?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; the man replied, &ldquo;full five-and-twenty are there held in chains
      beyond the mount where stands my dwelling-place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, O!&rdquo; said Jaufry, &ldquo;these I must set free; it likes me not that thou
      shouldst guard such prize.&rdquo; Without delay he hied him to the house, whose
      massive portals were thrown open wide; and to a dwarf who stood before the
      gates he cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where lie the imprison'd knights?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Replied the dwarf:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Methinks you're all too rash to venture here. 'Tis more indeed than
      rashness,&mdash;downright folly. You wake my pity; therefore take advice,
      and get you gone before my lord returns, save that you covet an inglorious
      death, or torments even worse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jaufry with smiles replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, <span class="pagenum"><a name="link066" id="link066"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p066.jpg">066</a></span>friend, I want the knights; quickly
      lead on, that I may break their chains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An I mistake not, you will join their ranks ere you deliver them; and I
      must hold you as a fool distraught, not to have hied you hence; for should
      my lord chance meet you by the way, deeply you'll grieve that e'er you
      ventured here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thy lord will ne'er return; I have deprived him of his nimble feet, and
      near his end he lies. The knights shall now be free, and thou, my
      prisoner, their place shalt take, save that thou goest where my bidding
      sends; then peradventure brief shall be thy thrall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir knight,&rdquo; the dwarf replied, &ldquo;since, then, my lord is thus so poorly
      sped, I, by my faith, will follow your commands, and from great pain will
      draw those suffering knights, whose language is but moans; this featly
      will I do, who by constraint and fear was here detained. Truly, to God and
      you we should give thanks, and joyfully obey what you ordain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First, then,&rdquo; said Jaufry, &ldquo;lead me to the knights.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dwarf most gladly acted as his guide; and pacing on before, conveyed
      him to a hall where five-and-twenty knights were rudely chained, as each
      by turns <span class="pagenum"><a name="link067" id="link067"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p067.jpg">067</a></span>had been the yeoman's prey. Jaufry
      on entering made them a salute, to which not one replied; nay, they began
      to weep, and mutter in their teeth:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Accurs'd the day that yeoman was e'er born, who thus hath overcome so
      good a knight!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Jaufry, as he gaily drew him nigh:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why weep, fair knights?&rdquo; he said, with courtesy. &ldquo;Go, madman, go,&rdquo; did
      one of them reply; &ldquo;for sure thy senses must have left thee quite, to ask
      us why we weep, when walls like these rise up on ev'ry side. There is not
      one of us who doth not grieve to see the yeoman's prisoner in thee.
      Unhappy was the day that saw thy birth. In person thou art tall and fair
      to view, yet soon like ours will torments be thy lot.&rdquo; Quoth Jaufry,
      &ldquo;Great is God; easy to Him can your deliverance be. Through Him my sword
      hath 'venged you on your foe, and now the yeoman lies deprived of feet.
      If, then, you see me in this weary spot, 'tis but to break your chains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Scarce had the words escaped from out his mouth, when loudly did they
      call:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happy the day which dawned upon thy birth; for thou hast saved us all,
      and swept our pain and martyrdom away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then <span class="pagenum"><a name="link068" id="link068"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p068.jpg">068</a></span>Jaufry bade the dwarf set free the
      knights; the manikin obeyed, and with a hammer broke in bits their chains.
      They all arose, and bowed their heads in token of submission, whilst they
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord, we are thy serfs; do with us as thou please, be it for good or
      evil, as is fit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good knights,&rdquo; Sir Jaufry said, &ldquo;whate'er of evil may henceforth betide
      you, none shall come from me. All that I ask of you is simply this, that
      ye betake you to King Arthur's court, and tell him all you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; they all exclaimed, &ldquo;full willingly shall thy behest be done;
      but to the service rendered, add one more by telling us thy name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barons,&rdquo; said Jaufry then, &ldquo;tell him the son of Dovon burst your chains.
      Now quickly set ye out; and, mark, my friendship ne'er shall be bestowed,
      if that ye fail to tell the king each word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dwarf meanwhile had gone to seek the arms and fetch the steeds to
      furnish forth the knights. Each donned his hauberk, mounted his good
      horse, and then with Jaufry parted from that spot. He led them to the
      great highway, and in their company rode full a league. In passing by, he
      pointed to the place where, cold and motionless, the yeoman lay: they
      stayed an instant <span class="pagenum"><a name="link069" id="link069"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p069.jpg">069</a></span>to observe their foe, then went
      upon their road. A little further Jaufry got him down, and tightened more
      his goodly charger's girths; then, his impatience to fall in with Taulat
      reviving in full force:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God speed you, sirs,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I can delay no more; already have I
      wasted too much time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; replied the knights, as they presented him his shield and
      lance, &ldquo;accept again our thanks: where'er we be, the service thou hast
      done in this great fight shall widely be proclaimed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When that the band had watched him out of sight, they went their way until
      they reached Carlisle. They found King Arthur in his flowery mead with
      five-and-twenty of his primest knights. There, kneeling at his feet, one
      of the troop was spokesman for the rest; and thus he fearlessly and sagely
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, so please it the true God, who knoweth all that every creature
      doth, give you good luck, and guard from pain and ill the greatest king
      this world doth now contain!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friend,&rdquo; the good king replied, &ldquo;God and St. Mary keep thee and thy
      mates! Speak without fear, and tell me what thou wilt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, <span class="pagenum"><a name="link070" id="link070"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p070.jpg">070</a></span>we come to yield ourselves to thee,
      from Jaufry, Dovon's son; he hath delivered us from durance vile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good sir, give me at once your tidings. Is't long since you and he have
      parted company?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We left him, sire, on Tuesday morning last, both safe and sound, ardent
      and full of strength, tracking a lord with whom he seeks to fight, and to
      avenge thy cause.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Lord, thou glorious Sire,&rdquo; said the king, with joined hands, &ldquo;grant I
      may Jaufry see unchecked, unscathed; for, an I hold him not within six
      months, I'll prize my fortunes as of nothing worth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whilst that the dwarf in turn begins his speech, to tell the king how this
      adventure happed, we will go back to follow Jaufry's steps, who still,
      unwearied, presses stoutly on.

      CHAPTER V. THE CASTLE OF THE LEPER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The <span class="pagenum"><a name="link071" id="link071"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p071.jpg">071</a></span>knight had rode for great part of
      the day beneath the rays of a most burning sun, and horse and rider both
      alike fatigued, when he beheld a young and handsome squire running towards
      him at his greatest speed. Rent was his garment even to his waist; and on
      he came, with madness in his looks, tearing by handfuls his fair curling
      hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarce did he make out Jaufry from afar when he exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fly, fly, brave knight, fly quickly from this spot, an that thou choosest
      not to lose thy life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And wherefore so, fair friend?&rdquo; asked Dovon's son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fly, for the love of God, say I; nor lose thou further time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Art <span class="pagenum"><a name="link072" id="link072"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p072.jpg">072</a></span>thou, then, shorn of sense,&rdquo;
       exclaimed the knight, &ldquo;such counsel to propose, when I behold no foe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried the squire then, &ldquo;he comes; he's there; nor think I in a year
      to cure the fright that he hath caused me! He hath slain my lord,&mdash;a
      knight of price, who was conducting to his castle-home his lady-wife, a
      Norman count's most noble daughter. This wretch hath seized the bride; and
      to myself has caused such dire fear, that ev'ry limb still trembles at the
      shock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is't because <i>thou</i> fearest,&rdquo; asked Sir Jaufry, red with rage,
      &ldquo;thou counsell'st flight to <i>me?</i> By holy faith, I hold thee fool,
      and worse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke thus, a leper came in sight, who sped along, a child within
      his arms. Its wretched mother, with dishevelled hair, followed with
      piercing cries. When she beheld the knight, she knelt down at his feet,
      and in a tone of agony exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy, my lord; O, mercy! For the love of Heaven, grant me help, and get
      me back the child yon leper bears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Woman,&rdquo; responded Jaufry, &ldquo;wherefore takes he it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My <span class="pagenum"><a name="link073" id="link073"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p073.jpg">073</a></span>lord, because it is his wicked
      will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had he no other cause?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, by your glorious sire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since it is thus,&rdquo; quoth Jaufry, &ldquo;he is wrong; and I will try to win it
      back for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spurred at once his horse, she following; and cried aloud, with all the
      strength he had:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halt, leprous, wicked wretch! and bring thou back the child!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The leper turned his head and raised his hand, making the mark of scorn;
      which so enraged the knight, he swore the insult deeply to avenge. The
      hideous leper answered with a laugh; for he had reached the threshold of
      his door. He darted in for refuge, followed full speed by Jaufry; who,
      dismounting from his horse, which with his lance he left to the poor dame,
      dashed through the castle-gate with sword in hand and shield upon his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he was traversing the castle through, which he found vast and sumptuous
      to the view, he came into a hall where a huge leper, frightful to behold,
      had cast upon a couch a damsel in first youth, whose beauty in that age
      could scarce be matched. Her cheek was fresher than an opening rose at
      break of day, and her torn <span class="pagenum"><a name="link074"       id="link074"></a><a href="../44433-page-images/p074.jpg">074</a></span>vesture
      half-betrayed a bosom snowy white. Her eyes were bathed in tears; her
      words, despair, and sobs, moved Jaufry's soul: but when the leper rose and
      seized his club, such feelings changed to horror and surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was in height more tall than knightly lance, and at the shoulders was
      two fathoms broad: his arms and hands were huge, his fingers crookt and
      full of knots, his cheeks were spread with pustules and with scales; a
      broken pupil, eyes without lids but with vermilion edged, blue lips, and
      yellow teeth, made up the portrait of this monster dread. Fiercer than
      living coal he flew on Jaufry, bidding him straight to yield.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, certes,' the knight replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, who in evil hour sent thee here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pray what seekest thou?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A child, that from its mother hath been torn by lep'rous hands, which
      must give up their prey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vain fool, 'tis <i>I</i> forbid,&mdash;I, by whose mace thy fate shall
      now be sealed; better for thee thou hadst not risen the morn, since thou
      shalt now for ever lay thee down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His club he raised in uttering these words, and on the <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link075" id="link075"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p075.jpg">075</a></span>shield of Jaufry then let fall so
      fierce a blow, the knight went reeling to the ground. Again that club was
      raised; but Jaufry rose and fled. Certes he had cause to flee the stroke
      he saw impending; for that huge mass of iron as it fell made the vast hall
      to tremble. Then Jaufry, with a bound, before the leper stood, and with
      firm hand dealt him in turn a blow which took a palm from off his raiment
      and the flesh behind. Seeing his blood, which fast began to stream, the
      giant uttered first a fearful cry, then ran at Jaufry, raising his knotted
      club with both his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarce could the youthful knight evade the stroke and leap behind a
      column; the monster struck it with such dire strength, the massive iron
      crushed the marble plinth, and all the castle groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the damsel fervently prayed Heaven, as humbly on the
      blood-stained stones she knelt:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, mighty Lord, who in Thy image didst great Adam make; Thou who hast
      done so much to save us all,&mdash;now save me from this wretch, and let
      yon knight withdraw me from his hands!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her orison scarce o'er, Jaufry stepped out, and ere the giant could again
      his heavy club let fall, he with his trenchant blade had severed his right
      arm. Being thus <span class="pagenum"><a name="link076" id="link076"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p076.jpg">076</a></span>lopped, the monster in his wrath
      and agony so loudly groaned, the palace trembled to its very base and
      shook the outer air. In vain did Jaufry dodge his falling mace, it struck
      him to the ground; so that from nostrils, eyes, and mouth, the purple
      stream burst forth. The mace, in falling on the marble flags, now brake in
      twain, which Jaufry seeing, he uprose in haste, and newly struck the
      leper; at the knee-joint he aimed; the monster reeled, then fell like some
      great tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prone as the leper lay, Jaufry ran up, his sword in air, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Methinks that peace will soon be made 'twixt you and me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then letting fall his sword with both his hands, he clove the monster's
      head e'en to the teeth. In the convulsions of his agony still fiercely
      strove the wretch, and with his foot hurled him so madly 'gainst the
      distant wall, Sir Jaufry fell deprived of sound and sight. His trembling
      hand no longer clutched his sword; like ruby wine, from nostrils and from
      mouth burst forth his blood, and motion made he none.*

      thought her champion was gone. In grief she hastened to undo the straps
      which bound his polished casque. The freshness drawing from his breast a
      sigh, she ran for water, and his face she bathed. His senses
      half-re-turned, he staggered up, and thinking still to hold his trusty
      blade, he struck the damsel,&mdash;deeming her the foe,&mdash;to such
      effect that both rolled on the ground. Like madman then he sped around the
      hall, and ran behind a column, where he crouched and trembled 'neath his
      shield.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Twas there the damsel came; and in a voice of dulcet tone, she said:
    </p>

      &ldquo;Brave knight, come, ope again those manly eyes, and see who 'tis that
      speaks. Forget ye what is due to chivalry, of which you are a lord? your
      courage and your fame? Recall yourself, and lower that bright shield;

      Jaufry <span class="pagenum"><a name="link078" id="link078"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p078.jpg">078</a></span>recovered at this heart'ning
      speech, and finding his head bare,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damsel,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;who hath removed my casque, and taken my good sword?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Myself, good lord, whilst you were in a swoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The giant, what doth he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bathed in his blood and at your feet he lies.&rdquo; Jaufry looked up, and when
      the corpse he saw thus shattered and quite still, he slowly rose, and sat
      him on a bench until his senses were again restored; then, when the
      dizziness had fled his brain, he thought upon the mother and the child,
      and straightway ran from hall to hall to search the infant out. But though
      he sought and ran and called aloud, neither the leper nor the child
      appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will yet search and search,&rdquo; he then exclaimed; &ldquo;or here or out the
      door they must be found; for I'll not hold me at a denier's worth till to
      the mother her poor child's restored, and I've had vengeance for that
      leper's scorn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With such resolve, he strode towards the door; but though the portal was
      thrown open wide, he could not pass it through. Spite of his will, his
      efforts, and his strength, <span class="pagenum"><a name="link079"       id="link079"></a><a href="../44433-page-images/p079.jpg">079</a></span>his feet seemed
      stopped before an unseen bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heaven,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what! am I then entranced?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew him back, and gathering for a spring, with wond'rous force he
      bounded to the door. Still all was vain, he could not cross the sill.
      Again and yet again he tried, till deep discouragement iced o'er his
      heart. Then tears broke from his eyes, and murmuring:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, good Lord,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Thou gav'st me strength to kill yon wicked
      wretch; what boots it, if I here must captive be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      'Twas as he thus bemoaned his adverse fate, there broke upon his ear from
      some nigh place a sound of infant tongues, which sadly cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Save us, O, save us, mighty lord!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Swift at the sound he roused his spirit up, and running, found at one end
      of a hall a close-shut door fast bolted from within. Jaufry called out,
      and struck it with great noise; yet answer none was made: enraged at this,
      he burst it in with force, and with his naked blade entered a gloomy
      vault. There was the leper found, with knife in hand, who seven infants
      had just put <span class="pagenum"><a name="link080" id="link080"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p080.jpg">080</a></span>to death. Some thirty more there
      still remained alive, whose bitter cries went through the softened soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Touched at the frightful sight, Jaufry struck down the wretch, who called
      his master's help; and then in wrath exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thy master, villain, can no answer make; his soul this earth hath fled:
      and thou, for erstwhile making mock of me, shalt now thy meed receive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Raising meanwhile his arm, the leper's hand he severed at a blow. The
      wretch upon the blood-stained pavement rolled; then crawling to his feet,
      he humbly cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy, good knight; in God's name, pity me, and take not quite my life!
      'Twas by constraint and force I killed these babes. My lord, who sought to
      cure his leprosy, bade me, with awful threats, each day prepare a bath of
      human blood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thy life I'll grant,&rdquo; quoth Jaufry to him then, &ldquo;an that thou give me
      means to leave this place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can,&rdquo; the leper said; &ldquo;but had you now deprived me of my life, not
      knowing of the spell, a hundred thousand years had rolled their course,
      and yet not seen you free.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haste <span class="pagenum"><a name="link081" id="link081"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p081.jpg">081</a></span>thee, then, now,&rdquo; quoth Jaufry,
      eagerly. &ldquo;Sir knight,&rdquo; the man with shining face replied, &ldquo;you still have
      much to bear. Such is the fashion of this castle's spell, my lord alone
      could power grant to such as hither came to cross the threshold; but never
      did they pass it in return save dead or maimed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, then, wilt thou succeed?&rdquo; said Jaufry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spy you, on top of yonder casement high, a marble head?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yea, by my faith! And then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lo, reach it down; and break it fair in twain; you'll thus destroy the
      charm: but first your armour carefully put on; for when the spell is o'er,
      these castle-walls will crumble into dust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Trusting not wholly to the lep'rous wretch, Jaufry then bound him by the
      feet and arms, and to the damsel thus confided him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he hath lied,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;spare not his life.&rdquo; Then he resumed his
      helm, took down the marble head, whose shape was fair and cunningly
      devised, and setting it near him on a wooden bench, discharged on't with
      his sword so great a blow, he clove it dean in twain. Sudden it shrieked,
      it moaned, it bounded up, hissing and growling as a thunderbolt; whilst
      the vexed <span class="pagenum"><a name="link082" id="link082"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p082.jpg">082</a></span>elements at once unchained, and
      beam and stone at war with frightful din came crushing over Jaufry. Vainly
      his shield was raised to guard his head; Heaven's face was darkened o'er;
      an awful storm, where wind and lightning strove, bursting with ruin, 'mid
      the ambient air had borne the knight away, but for his orison to heaven's
      King. Huge clouds of dust rose upwards to the skies; while a fierce wind,
      in passing, swept away the last memorial of the magic work: of castle
      naught remained.

    <p>
      Bowed down, and scarce himself, did Jaufry move his limbs. Bowed down and
      bruised and tottering, dragged he some steps, then fell. The maid, the
      slave, and mother with her child, who had sought refuge 'neath a huge
      rock's vault, found him at length outstretched upon the turf, his strength
      exhausted and quite motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, then, good knight,&rdquo; the damsel smiling spoke, &ldquo;how fares it with you
      now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no bruise that's perilous, nor mortal wound,&rdquo; replied the knight;
      &ldquo;but such this latter strife, I find, indeed, I sadly lack repose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The damsel then embraced him with her arms, and pressed her lips upon his
      eyes and mouth. When Jaufry saw the mother,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Woman,&rdquo; <span class="pagenum"><a name="link083" id="link083"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p083.jpg">083</a></span>he said, &ldquo;hast thou regained thy
      child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have, my lord; thanks, be it told, to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An it be so, proceed then to Carlisle, with this fair damsel, babes, and
      leper,&mdash;all. There I must beg you go, King Arthur thank, from Jaufry,
      Dovon's son, and tell him of this fight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus speaking, he uprose; drew to his fancy his good horse's girths; and
      having consigned his friends to Heaven's care, resumed his quest of
      Taulat: albeit 'twas now with measured steps and slow; for this dread
      battle had worn out his strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having obtained her mantle and her horse, the maid set out from thence at
      the like hour, and with her went the leper and the rest; nor stayed she on
      the way, but only stopped when she had reached fair Carlisle's lofty
      towers.
    </p>
    <p>
      There all regarded her with wonderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whence can proceed,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;this strange cortège? whence come these
      people? and what want they here?&rdquo; The curious crowd followed that damsel
      fair up to the castle-gates, and there the knights, who noble escort made,
      led her with all her troop before the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      There <span class="pagenum"><a name="link084" id="link084"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p084.jpg">084</a></span>bended she her knee, and as a dame
      of gentle breeding spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May He, the Lord of all and of all things, who in His hands doth justly
      hold the keys of good and ill, increase your fame, and keep in glory the
      knights of your Round Table!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And,&rdquo; said the worthy king, &ldquo;may Heaven save you, sweet damsel, who are
      fair and good as courteous and well-bred!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, from Jaufry, Dovon's son, I come, to thank you for my life; which
      to his mighty valour do I owe. I am the daughter of the Count Passant,
      whose name perchance hath reached your royal ear. A knight of high esteem,
      who sought adventure to display his worth, brought me from Normandy to
      these fair shores. For seven long months, by valley and by hill we
      wandered on, full many a snare escaping, and without check full many a
      weary fight. This land did hold, alas, a giant dread, of hideous aspect,
      and of awful strength, eaten with leprosy and fearful sores, whose thought
      doth make my very soul to heave. Before us suddenly this wretch appeared;
      and taking from his neck a monstrous club, struck at my lord with force so
      terrible, he stunned him with the blow. Like as a child <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link085" id="link085"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p085.jpg">085</a></span>then, clutching at his arm, against
      a rock he fractured every bone; whilst me he seized from off my palfrey's
      back, and to his magic castle quickly bore. There I had lost my life, yea,
      more than life, but that high Heaven, whose justice I implored, in mercy
      sent Sir Jaufry to my aid. This doughty knight at length the monster slew;
      but ne'er can I with greater truth aver, such battle never did these eyes
      behold, or blows so great e'er given and received.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mother and the handless leper told their tale in turn. But whilst they
      thus their message each relates, we will to Jaufry go, who onward still
      his course doth slowly take, without he yet a single soul descried who
      could give tidings of the man he sought.

      CHAPTER VI. THE ORCHARD OF BRUNISSENDE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Harassed, <span class="pagenum"><a name="link087" id="link087"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p087.jpg">087</a></span>fatigued, and sore with many a
      bruise, Jaufry was sinking too for food and drink; and yet the want of
      sleep,&mdash;of all our wants the most imperious,&mdash;so weighed him
      down, he scarce could keep his seat. Still he went on a quarter of the
      night with limbs benumbed and eyelids partly closed, taking such course
      his charger pleased to lead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serene and lovely was the atmosphere, and by the light the stars in
      shining gave he by adventure a large orchard saw, shut in with marble
      walls and skirt with trees of umbrage such as earth scarce saw before.
      Flowers and fragrant herbs abounded there; and with each <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link088" id="link088"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p088.jpg">088</a></span>puff of wind there issued out a
      sweet and balmy breath like paradise. 'Twas thus that, as night fell, the
      birds for leagues around did hither flock, and perching on the leafy
      boughs, warbled their dulcet notes till matin prime.
    </p>
    <p>
      This orchard appertained to a great dame known as fair Brunissende. Within
      the castle of Montbrun she lived; and father, mother, husband, had she
      none; fine was her court and rich, of breeding high; and knights and
      burghers, minstrels, jugglers from all countries, hither trooping came.
      The palace, built of hewn and massive stone whereon the sculptor had
      employed his art, was flanked with towers blackened o'er by time. 'Twas in
      the centre Brunissende was lodged; and to it seven gates a passage gave,
      whereof the keepers could each one lead forth a thousand men.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>

    </h4>
    <p>
      Five hundred damsels waited her commands; but though 'twere rare to see
      such beauty met, yet Brunissende held empire over all in loveliness and
      grace: one might have sought throughout the realms of earth, and yet not
      found such high and gentle dame, or one so fine in form. Her eyes and her
      sweet face swept from the mind of those who gazed on her all thought of
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="link089" id="link089"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p089.jpg">089</a></span>former charms. She was more fresh,
      more fair, more purely white than snow that lies upon the frosted dew, and
      rose that opens on a lily's breast. *

    <p>
      But, ah, felicity did not attend her charms. Yielding to some deep grief,
      four times a day she sadly wept and mourned; and thrice she rose at night
      to mourn again. Her sole delight was listening to the notes of those sweet
      birds which filled her orchard near; which, when she had heard, she got
      some brief repose,&mdash;soon to awake again to weep and mourn; and all
      her vassals, of each age and sex, little and great, at that same hour of
      woe uttered the self-same moans, and shed like tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived, as we already said, before her orchard fair, Jaufry got down; and
      seeing an open gate, he ventured in, removed the bridle from his charger's
      mouth, so that <span class="pagenum"><a name="link090" id="link090"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p090.jpg">090</a></span>he grazed at ease, and his shield
      placing 'neath his weary head, his limbs outstretching on the flowery
      turf, he soon most soundly slept. Just then did Brunissende her footsteps
      take towards her chamber, followed by her maids. Surprised the birds no
      longer tuned their notes, she straightway bade the seneschal appear, to
      whom she said with wrath:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some creature surely must have passed the gates, and scared my gentle
      birds. Go, quickly find it out; and if perchance a man it prove to be, he
      must be hither brought, alive or dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; the seneschal at once replied, &ldquo;I go with speed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two squires preceding him, each with a lighted torch, his horse he
      mounted, and rode down in haste, and in the orchard found the weary
      knight, wrapt in profoundest sleep. He called him frequently, then shook
      him hard; but for a time in vain. His eyes at length with effort he
      unclosed, when, raising up his head,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fair knight,&rdquo; quoth he most courteously, &ldquo;by thine attainments and thy
      gentle birth, I do entreat thee, in God's name, to let me here abide and
      sleep my fill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sleep <span class="pagenum"><a name="link091" id="link091"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p091.jpg">091</a></span>must you now no more,&rdquo; replied the
      chief, &ldquo;but come before my lady; she'll not rest until avenged on him who
      scares her birds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Quoth Jaufry:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God permit, thou shalt not take me off without a fight!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The seneschal, on hearing such resolve, called to his squire to bring him
      out his arms. Meanwhile the son of Dovon slept again; so that the
      seneschal, when fall equipped, was forced a second time to wake him up,
      and roughly as at first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knight,&rdquo; exclaimed Jaufry, as he then arose, &ldquo;'tis a great sin to trouble
      my repose, for I am wearied out; but since thou hast chosen to accept the
      fight, wilt thou allow me to sleep on in peace if I do thee unhorse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Heaven's faith, I swear't!&rdquo; laughing, the other said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jaufry then hastened to his horse's side; replaced the bit, and tightly
      drew the girths. Mounted, he galloped at the seneschal; who, having drawn
      him back a space, on rushing drove his lance at Jaufry's shield, but never
      harmed the knight. He, on the contrary, with happy stroke unhorsed the
      seneschal; who, full <span class="pagenum"><a name="link092" id="link092"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p092.jpg">092</a></span>of shame, with head bowed down, and
      slow and thoughtful step, regained the castle and his lady's room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is't,&rdquo; asked Brunissende, &ldquo;that there doth lurk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A knight all armed, whose peer the world not holds, sleeping so soundly
      he would scarce awake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why broughtst thou him not here? I wish him hither led; for, with God's
      help, no food shall pass these lips till that bold knight be hanged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; replied the seneschal, &ldquo;he would not come; nor could I wake him
      up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; quoth she; &ldquo;then bid the tocsin sound, and rouse me up my
      knights.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The seneschal obeyed; the sound was heard, and straightway flocking came
      five hundred knights. The hall they entered, where their lady stood with
      spite and anger pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barons,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;a bold and wicked knight my grounds hath passed, and
      will not quit the walls; now if his head pay not this insolence, I never
      will hold land or honour more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; replied a tall and proper knight of great renown,&mdash;Simon the
      Red by name,&mdash;&ldquo;I will go seek him <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link093" id="link093"></a><a href="../44433-page-images/p093.jpg">093</a></span>out,
      if such your wish; and trust, alive or dead, to bring him here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; said Brunissende.
    </p>
    <p>
      Added the seneschal:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My troth, good friend, I bid thee shield thyself. He can most sturdily
      defend his sconce; and brave indeed I'll hold the happy knight who takes
      it off by force.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Simon, without a word, went on his way, and Jaufry found still sleeping;
      rudely he cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up, up, sir knight; arouse!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jaufry, who moved not more than any rock, received from Simon then so
      strong a kick, it woke him up in haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nathless, thou promisedst to let me sleep,&rdquo; he then exclaimed; &ldquo;and 'tis
      a villain's act to break thy faith, when thus I'm overcome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, speak then to my lady,&rdquo; Simon said; &ldquo;or I by force must take thee
      to the hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We first will see who's strongest,&mdash;thou or I,&rdquo; said Jaufry in low
      tone; when, springing on his horse, he ran at Simon, who like haste
      displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bold Simon's lance was split on Jaufry's shield; but he was borne by that
      of his brave foe so swift to earth, <span class="pagenum"><a name="link094"       id="link094"></a><a href="../44433-page-images/p094.jpg">094</a></span>it nearly cost
      his life. Jaufry ran up, as though to make it sure, when loud he called
      for grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wilt thou annoy me further in my sleep, if I do grant it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, lord, I promise thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, then,&rdquo; said Jaufry, who again lay down, and quick reclosed his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simon the Red, with flush upon his face and shame at heart, slowly
      retraced his steps. Certes, did he make but half the noise he made on
      setting out; so that the seneschal, who watched him come, could not
      withhold his smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;behold your champion; but with him comes no knight. I'd
      wage my spurs, like me, he has taken oath.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maugre this pleasantry,&rdquo; the dame replied, &ldquo;ere I have rest, this naughty
      knight shall hang.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hearing the words, one of the keepers of the seven gates descended to the
      orchard; but soon his troop returned, bearing him faint and bleeding on
      his shield. At such a spectacle, fair Brunissende could scarce contain her
      rage,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>

    </h4>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! have I round me naught but coward folk,&rdquo; she loudly cried, &ldquo;and
      knights without a heart? Go <span class="pagenum"><a name="link095"       id="link095"></a><a href="../44433-page-images/p095.jpg">095</a></span>fifty; if it
      need, go thrice that number still; but bring this vassal, or no more
      return!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this reproach, the knights rushed off in troop, and to the garden hied
      with dash and din. When there, they Jaufry seized,&mdash;some by the arm,
      and others by the leg; while some his shoulders held, and some his head,
      and brought him thus into that lordly hall without his being able to stir
      limb. On seeing them arrive, the dame impatient came with hasty step and
      bade them set him free. They loosed their hold, and Jaufry stood upright;
      nor could he think, as round his glance was thrown, 'twas sport that
      brought him 'mong such iron folk. Tall and well-shaped, his natural manly
      grace, set off with hauberk rich and burnished casque, struck Brunissende,
      who eyed him curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis you,&rdquo; at length she said, &ldquo;who all this ill have wrought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fair lady,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;so far am I from doing what you say, or causing
      you annoy, I would defend you with my utmost strength 'gainst all of
      mother born.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that you say not truth; for you erewhile have so misused my knight,
      that he may chance to die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <span class="pagenum"><a name="link096" id="link096"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p096.jpg">096</a></span>own it, lady fair, but he was in
      the wrong; having by oath engaged to let me sleep, he thrice returned to
      wake me up, and struck me with his lance. Still, had I known him feoffee
      to you, never on him had risen this knightly hand, e'en for a greater
      cause.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter! I can see,&rdquo; replied the dame, &ldquo;we 'll find in you,&mdash;and
      that ere morning sun,&mdash;a proper subject for the cord, or worse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whilst thus she spoke, Jaufry regarded her; and ne'er had tired admiring
      her brow, her neck, her fair and sweet fresh face, her rosy mouth, and
      blue and loving eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; quoth he, love gliding o'er his soul, &ldquo;do with me what you will;
      for with no other arms than that rich robe, you would have vanquished me
      with greater ease than ten knights clad in mail. If, 'gainst my knowledge,
      I have caused you pain, wreak now your own revenge; and never 'gainst you
      shall uprise my sword, or lance or shield be used.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hearing him reason thus so courteously, the dame forgets her wrath. Love
      with his golden shaft hath pierced her heart, and now she pardons all.
      Those lips still bear a menace to the ear; but those sweet eyes belie't.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grown <span class="pagenum"><a name="link097" id="link097"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p097.jpg">097</a></span>bold, the knight, who still did on
      her gaze, begged her to grant a boon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but slumber at my ease; then do what justice bids.
      Fear not that I shall hence seek means to fly; for, Heaven preserve me,
      you have somehow gained such power o'er my soul, that you alone are better
      guard than are ten hundred of your men with arms in hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fair Brunissende retired with a sigh, leaving for sole adieu a look so
      sweet, that, spite of his dull sense, it filled his heart with joy.
      Meantime the seneschal, whose care it was, bade the attendants then
      prepare a couch in middle of the hall: he there conducted Jaufry, and then
      asked his name and country.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm of King Arthur's court,&rdquo; quoth Dovon's son; &ldquo;now prithee ask no more,
      but, in God's name, let me in quiet rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Full armed as he then was, he laid him down, and sleep his eyelids closed.
      Not so fair Brunissende. Love in her chamber had renewed the assault, and
      banished sleep away; and thus she mused, until the city-watch gave forth
      the accustomed sound. At that trumpet's call, each in the castle and the
      city rose; and all at once gave loose to tears and groans. High dames
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="link098" id="link098"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p098.jpg">098</a></span>and damsels, Brunissende in chief,
      clasping their hands in sign of deepest woe, beat their fair breasts and
      face; while the knights who guarded Jaufry made such dreadful din, it woke
      him up, and made him ask the cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at the word rushed forward to the couch, and struck with lance and
      sword and iron mace. Well 'twas for him his hauberk was of proof; for the
      blows came just like to a storm of hail. Nor did they cease, thinking the
      knight was dead, until the doleful cries had died away. Then each resumed
      his post, and silence fell o'er all. Again, at mid of night, those cries
      uprose; but Jaufry, whom no sleep again had blessed, and whose cleared
      thoughts were fixed on Brunissende, took careful note to guard his curious
      tongue; holding his breath, he said within himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certes are these men no folk of flesh and blood, but demons hither sent
      to pester earth. With Heaven's help, to-morrow's blessed sun shan't light
      upon me here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Persuaded he was dead after that storm of blows, the knights relaxed their
      watch, and slumbered at their posts; Jaufry then seized the chance, and
      noiselessly uprose. With shield and lance in hand, he left the
      castle-halls <span class="pagenum"><a name="link099" id="link099"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p099.jpg">099</a></span>on tip of toe; by good luck found
      his horse, and mounting quick, at fullest speed set out. Had he but dreamt
      the love fair Brunissende conceived, not all her men-at-arms would from
      Montbrun have chased him but with slaughter. Little deemed he, as hill and
      dale he crossed with breathless speed, she at that hour was in her fancy
      musing how she might make him hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who shall depict, as rose the sun next mom, fair Brunissende's dismay,
      when, of the first who to the hall came down, she heard of Jaufry's
      flight? As one deprived of sense, those hundred knights she loudly did
      accuse of treason to their faith; their negligence she banned; and to the
      seneschal in wrath exclaimed, that, if he found not Jaufry, he should by
      fire or cord full surely die, even if torments yet unheard were hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst that this scene was passing at Montbrun, Jaufry already was well on
      his road. And shortly after rising of the sun, he met a neatherd, driving
      of a car laden with bread and wine and other things. This man invited him,
      by holy charity, to eat with him; and used such kindly words, that Jaufry
      yielded to his hearty wish, frankly avowing that for three whole days he
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="link100" id="link100"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p100.jpg">100</a></span>had not tasted food. The neatherd
      therefore took his shield and lance, drew from his car good wheaten bread
      and wine, two roasted capons, three grilled partridges, and part of a
      wild-boar; then, spreading on the turf beneath a leafy tree a fair white
      cloth, a brook just bubbling by, he served the knight, and paid him great
      respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had eat their fill, and in their thirst emptied two bowls of
      wine, Jaufry prepared to go, thanking the neatherd for his welcome meal.
      This man was vassal to fair Brunissende, the lady of high worth; and as
      the knight was turning to depart, he drew the charger's rein and gently
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good friend, one thing I fain would ask of you, which I had half-forgot:
      why do the people of this fair domain so weep and loudly moan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, rascal, wretch, thou traitor, and thou fool!&rdquo; exclaimed the neatherd,
      bursting forth with rage, &ldquo;thy wretched life shall answer for those
      words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With all his strength he then at Jaufry cast the pond'rous axe he bore,
      which struck his shield and brought out fire and flame. The knight spurred
      on his horse and got clear off; but mid a storm of stones. The neatherd
      then, enraged at missing him, shivered his car <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link101" id="link101"></a><a href="../44433-page-images/p101.jpg">101</a></span>to
      bits, and with his axe struck both his oxen dead. *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Cervantes has wittily parodied this adventure by that of
     the braying of the ass, which sets two villages of La Mancha
     at strife with each other (Aventura del rebuzno, parte ii.
     lib. vi. cap. xxv.).
</pre>
    <p>
      In ignorance of the cause of all this rage, Jaufry at length relaxed his
      horse's speed; still as he went exclaiming, that he'd hold as naught all
      that he yet had done till he had met a creature who could tell the reason
      of that wailing. Busied with such-like thoughts and the remembrance of
      fair Brunissende, he rode the live-long day, spite of fatigue and heat.
      When daylight waned, two youths well-horsed, with falcon on the fist, and
      hounds and terriers running at their feet, came up to him; and after
      slight discourse, invited him to share their evening meal,&mdash;and that
      so courteously, he could not make denial. The three young men then gaily
      went along, talking of love and battle's iron strife; when, as 'twas
      sunset, rose again that cry, at which the youths like madmen howled and
      wept.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good youths,&rdquo; quoth Jaufry, with astonishment, &ldquo;what means this grief?
      What heard you, sirs, I pray; and why such noise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Why?</i> <span class="pagenum"><a name="link102" id="link102"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p102.jpg">102</a></span>ask'st thou, foolish, treacherous
      serf? that word shall cost thy life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as one cast at him his startled bird, the other plucked his cap from
      off his head and threw it madly 'gainst bold Jaufry's shield. Their fury
      and hard words finished as ceased that cry; when, quickly following the
      wond'ring knight, with honeyed phrase they charmed away his wrath, and to
      their habitation led the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a châtelet of graceful form, girded by lofty walls and outer
      fosse, through which a living stream for ever ran. Beside the bridge there
      sat an aged knight, listing a minstrel's song,&mdash;<i>The Lay of the Two
      Lovers</i>. * It was the father of the two young men: beholding Jaufry, he
      in haste arose, and came to give him welcome; saying, with joyful tone: **
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Of Marie of France.

     ** This knight in Cervantes' hands is the nobleman clad in
     green (Cavaliero vestido en gavan de pano fino verde, parte
     ii. lib.  v. cap. xvi.).
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am beholden, lord, to those who've brought you: seven long years have
      flown since stranger-guest hath this my threshold crossed whose aspect
      pleased me so: God save you, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus speaking, by the arm the knight escorted Jaufry <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link103" id="link103"></a><a href="../44433-page-images/p103.jpg">103</a></span>to
      the hall, where the two youths removed his armour bright. Soon there came
      in a damsel fair, of fresh and smiling look, who brought him a rich
      mantle, which when he had put on, she, on a cushion placed beside him,
      sat. Then they discoursed on various pleasant things until 'twas time for
      water to be brought. A well-bred page did pour it o'er his hands, while
      the fair damsel held the ready bowl; at which Sir Jaufry said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maiden, I'll not this kindly act refuse; for should you e'er need service
      at my hands, whate'er the hour or place, you may full surely call me to
      your aid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They then at table sat; and when the meal was o'er, the cloth removed, the
      damsel went the couches to prepare, and left her father and the knight
      alone. The old man asked his name, and wept for joy to learn the son of
      Dovon was his guest,&mdash;his ancient friend in arms. He would have fain
      a month detained him there; but Jaufry cleverly excuses made, and at the
      point of day he in his saddle found himself again. The maid had given him
      his shield and lance, and he his leave was then about to take, when it
      occurred to him to ask his host about that wailing cry. Scarcely, however,
      was the question put when the old man and his two <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link104" id="link104"></a><a href="../44433-page-images/p104.jpg">104</a></span>sons
      alike assailed him with hard names: they called him knave and wretch and
      villain's son; they hair in that unseemly rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jaufry by dint of spur escaped their wrath; and wond'ring saw them on each
      other turn their fitful ire, and tear their clothes to rags. Their fury
      spent, they called him back again; and Jaufry, wishing to have news of
      Taulat, consented to return. As it fell out, no man could give him more.
      The aged knight well knew that champion fierce, and in these terms did
      tell him what he sought:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Follow,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;all day this very road; it leads across a tract of
      desert space, where ne'er are found or house or town, or bread or wine, or
      man of mother born. If you should wish in passing to repose, naught but
      the turf can be your host or tent. Go onward thus until to-morrow's sun.
      Before the noon you will have reached a plain, wherein is set a high and
      rugged mount. There, at its foot, a castle you'll behold, pleasant and
      finely built; and round its moats a crowd of tents and huts, where harbour
      knights and lords of high descent. Pass stoutly on, nor speak a word to
      man; go to the castle without stop or stay, whatever tried to strike at
      him with sturdy dubs, and tore their may <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link105" id="link105"></a><a href="../44433-page-images/p105.jpg">105</a></span>befall,
      and enter boldly in, leaving without your lance, and eke your shield.
      There will you find two dames,&mdash;one old, one young,&mdash;who watch a
      wounded knight. Go to the ancient dame, and to her say, that Augier de
      Cliart sends you there, that she may tell you why the people groan, and
      give you news of Taulat.&rdquo;

      href="../44433-page-images/p107.jpg">107</a></span>pleased at Augier's words, which
      seemed to raise his heart by full a span, Jaufry spurred bravely on, and
      by the morrow safely reached the spot his host had named. While he was
      passing through the scattered tents, the knights, who stared at him,
      exclaimed aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Behold a man who has ridden the night long, and hastens forward, but to
      seek his loss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seeming as though he never heard the words, he to the noble castle
      straightway hied; which seemed most rich, and sculptured with fine art.
      Seeing a portal set with marble leaves and tinged of various hues, he
      there got down, secured his horse, and near him placing both his lance and
      shield, he passed within the door. At first <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link108" id="link108"></a><a href="../44433-page-images/p108.jpg">108</a></span>his
      eyes no other forms beheld than those which omed the walls; but as he
      wandered on from room to room, he came at length where lay the wounded
      knight, and at his couch two dames in robes of woe, and tears upon their
      cheeks. As he was counselled by good Augier, then he to the elder went,
      and prayed her courteously, in Heaven's name, to tell him where was
      Taulat, and why the people of that land he left did day and night so weep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charmed with his breeding and his knightly words, the lady then explained
      that Taulat, whose brutality and pride exceeded bounds, would in eight
      days return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He comes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to glut his cruelty upon the wretched man who
      yonder lies. Seven years agone he with his lance did wound him cruelly;
      and when that wound is healed, each year, upon the feast-day of St. John,
      he has him fastened to a stake hard by, and beaten with a scourge until
      the wounds are opened once again. For this the vassals of the neighbouring
      land of Brunissende,&mdash;whereof this knight is lord,&mdash;weep and
      lament, and e'en do put to death those who would spy into their cause of
      grief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; Sir Jaufry said, &ldquo;pride slays its lord; and by <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link109" id="link109"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p109.jpg">109</a></span>that pride, I trust, will Taulat
      fall. In eight days' time to seek him I will come; and I can truly say
      that term will seem a year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Commending her to Heaven, he left those halls, mounted again his horse,
      and took his way towards a neighbouring wood, where he did trust some man
      to meet to lodge him in his hut. The wood was gloomy, intricate, and
      dense; and at the first cross-road before him, he beheld, squatted beneath
      a pine, a hag, whose aspect struck him with surprise.

      Her head was larger than a portal's arch; her eyes were small as deniers,
      bleared besides and blue, misshapen, and deep-sunk beneath projecting
      brows. Her lips were black; teeth red as orpiment, which jutted out
      unseemly from her jaw. Her arms were sinewy, and her hands all knots; her
      face was colourless and wrinkled o'er; her body puffed; her shoulders
      round and high; her legs were skinny and of brownish hue; her knees were
      pointed; her toe-nails so long, no shoe could ever have enclosed her feet.
      A verdant wreath encircled her white hair, which stiffly stood on end. Her
      under-garment was of linen fine; her robe of ruddy silk; and over all a
      scarlet mantle fell, with ermine lined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jaufry saluted her; meanwhile with awe he gazed upon <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link110" id="link110"></a><a href="../44433-page-images/p110.jpg">110</a></span>her
      figure strange, and ugly face. She turned her head, and without moving
      from her darksome seat, exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Retrace thy steps, sir knight, and that at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so, indeed,&rdquo; quoth Jaufry, &ldquo;till I learn why thou dost tell me thus
      to flee away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou wilt repent it, then,&rdquo; the hag replied; &ldquo;and death or dungeon shalt
      thou surely find.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And wherefore so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, and thou wilt learn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me at least with whom I'll have to strive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those thou shalt meet will say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And thou, too; what art thou?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What thou beholdst!&rdquo; the hag exclaimed, as, rising, she unfolded her huge
      length, tall as a knightly lance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven!&rdquo; Sir Jaufry cried, &ldquo;in thee I trust; what figure have we here?&rdquo;

      &ldquo;Dare to pass onwards,&rdquo; growled the wretched hag, &ldquo;and thou shalt meet
      with worse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nathless they stay not me: as to thy threats,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I hold them as
      the wind, or nothingness.&rdquo; Pricking his charger as he spoke the words, he
      passed along the path.

    <p>
      The hag, <span class="pagenum"><a name="link111" id="link111"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p111.jpg">111</a></span>however, had but told the truth.
      For as he reached a chapel small, a holy hermit served, a knight of sable
      hue, mounting a sable horse, with sable arms, assailed him with such
      strength and unawares, that horse and knight were on the turf o'er-thrown.
      Jaufry, all red with shame, at once upsprang, and, sword in hand, wished
      to avenge his fall; but, lo, no foe was there. He looked about, above,
      around, below, but horse and knight had vanished quite away. Again he
      mounted on his charger's back, when, at the instant, his strange foe
      returned, with lowered lance to strike at him again. Jaufry, prepared, now
      flew at him in turn; they midway met with shock so terrible, each rolled
      upon the earth. Half-wild with anger then, quick as the lightning Jaufry
      was afoot, with shield on guard and ready for the fight; but ne'er a foe
      was there.

      &ldquo;I will yet find him out,&rdquo; Sir Jaufry said, as in his saddle he again did
      leap. But scarce was foot in stirrup firmly set when back returned the
      sable knight, hissing and growling as the thunder doth when tempests vex
      the air, and for the third time bore him to the ground. Jaufry, on his
      side, had so aimed his lance, it pierced his foe right through, and cast
      him on the turf. But when <span class="pagenum"><a name="link112"       id="link112"></a><a href="../44433-page-images/p112.jpg">112</a></span>he wished to
      give the <i>coup-de-grace</i>, in vain he sought the knight, he neither
      saw nor heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heaven!&rdquo; Jaufry cried, &ldquo;where hath this recreant, this demon, fled?
      I drive my lance a fathom through his breast, I hurl him to the ground;
      and yet he flies, and doth escape my wrath! O gracious Lord, in Thee I put
      my trust!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again he mounted as he spoke these words; when the invisible once more
      appeared, unhorsing him anew. Why re-describe the scene? While daylight
      lasted, still this game went on. When off his horse, no creature did he
      see; but as he sat him on his charger's back the sable knight appeared to
      strike and hew. Weary of fight, Sir Jaufry then resolved to go on foot
      into the chapel-gate; but as he took his way, the spectre then his onward
      footsteps barred, so that the battle did again commence, and in the
      darkness without pause went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      For half that night their swords and lances clashed, so that bright sparks
      of fire upward flew; fatigued at length to hear such din of arms, the
      hermit rose, and with his stole and cross and holy water, chanting a
      psalm, forth issued from his cell. The sable knight did not attend his
      coming; shrieking aloud, at once he disappeared, albeit behind him leaving
      such a storm as <span class="pagenum"><a name="link113" id="link113"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p113.jpg">113</a></span>suffered no allay, until the
      chapel-bell rang out the matin hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sheltered by this good man, Sir Jaufry asked, and thus obtained from him,
      the secret of the knight with whom he had fought so long.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friend, what thou ask'st I'll tell thee in few words: this knight in
      sable armour is a fiend, evoked from realms of darkness by a hag, whom
      thou perchance hast met upon thy way. This hideous wretch once boasted as
      her spouse a monstrous giant, whose most wicked acts for twenty leagues
      around had spoiled the earth. As mortal, all-ferocious though he be, is
      ne'er without his peer, it happed this giant did return one night so
      grievously ill-used, that, at the end of three short days, he died. The
      hag, then, fearing for her own sad life and that of her two sons, called
      by her magic from the lower world that evil spirit who, for thirty years,
      these lands hath vexed. Meantime her sons have waxed in years and
      strength, and closely followed in their father's steps. Grown leprous,
      one, he dwelt within a house, built by his mother by the force of spells,
      whither his brother hath set out in haste, enraged and tost,&mdash;for
      that the rumour saith a knight of Arthur's court the wretch hath slain. An
      it <span class="pagenum"><a name="link114" id="link114"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p114.jpg">114</a></span>be true, may Heaven, all powerful,
      defend that knight!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will endeavour to defend himself,&rdquo; quoth Jaufry smiling; &ldquo;and the
      raged giant, if he held the wish, need not have gone so far to find him
      out: I am the man who did his brother slay, and by whose hand the wicked
      spell was burst.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eight days being fled, the hermit chanted mass, and at the altar prayed
      the holy saints to guide Sir Jaufry, and protect his life against the
      monster's wrath. Having devoutly joined him in the prayer, the son of
      Dovon, like a valiant knight, did joyously set out; and scarce had ridden
      for an hour's space when he beheld the giant swiftly come, bearing beneath
      his arm,&mdash;with the same ease as he had done a child,&mdash;a damsel,
      who did utter doleful cries. Her voice was hoarse from screaming out for
      help; her yellow hair, which sparkled in the sun, upon her shoulders all
      dishevelled fell like molten gold; her robe was tom, her eyes were swollen
      with tears; scarce, by Saint Mary! had she strength remaining to implore
      help of Jaufry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The knight, with pity touched, heard not in vain the prayer. His shield
      advanced, his lance within the rest, <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link115" id="link115"></a><a href="../44433-page-images/p115.jpg">115</a></span>he
      at the giant rode, and called aloud that he should loose the maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Letting her truly for an instant go, the giant ran towards the nearest
      tree, and pulling at the trunk, unearthed it, roots and all. Before,
      however, he had done so quite, Jaufry had plunged his lance into his side.
      Checked by the stroke, and trembling in the hand, the giant's blow lost
      half of its effect, yet ne'er the less it bore to mother earth both Jaufry
      and his steed. The knight full quickly leapt upon his feet; and with his
      ready sword struck at the monster with such vigorous hand, he sliced from
      off his flank a palm of flesh; and through the gaping wound one might
      behold his beating heart, whilst streams of blood poured through.
      Exhausted, tottering, still the giant overthrew the knight by striking
      with his fist upon his helm; but though his sword escaped from Jaufry's
      grasp, it was too late for harm,&mdash;the giant fainting fell. On this,
      the knight hewed off his monstrous feet; when, in all gentleness, the maid
      he raised, for she had kneeled at her preserver's side, and thus did say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Accept, my lord, a thousand grateful thanks; for more than life have you
      preserved for me, in saving me from him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damsel,&rdquo; <span class="pagenum"><a name="link116" id="link116"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p116.jpg">116</a></span>Sir Jaufry answered, &ldquo;God for ever
      aid you! But explain how is't I find you here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord, 'tis easy to relate the tale: but yesterday I in an orchard
      strayed, to which my mother had conducted me; it was our usual walk; when,
      as we left the gates, behold, yon giant suddenly appeared, seized me at
      once, and to his castle now was bearing me away, when you, sir knight, so
      happily stepped in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank great Heaven, it was just in time! But where, I pray you, was
      your worthy sire, and where your brothers, when this giant came?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hunting within the forest, good my lord: but you surprise me, asking me
      of them. One fain would say that you did know them all; and yet, methinks,
      I ne'er have seen yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sweet damsel, yea, and that few days agone. 'Twas at your father's,
      Augier's good house, where I, at need, so courteously was served by you
      and all of yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blest be the hour, gentle lord and knight, you harboured 'neath our roof;
      and we, how happy to have you for guest!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By this you see, my fair and courteous maid, how meet it is that we
      should service do, even to those unknown. <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link117" id="link117"></a><a href="../44433-page-images/p117.jpg">117</a></span>One
      knows not who shall go or who shall come, they who do hold or they who
      hold them not, or what the future keeps for us in store. Well it becomes
      us, then, to render help where help we can; welcome with courtesy, and
      honour guests with shelter and with food, whom chance may send us as they
      onward go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where, Sir Jaufry,&rdquo; then inquired the maid, &ldquo;if I may ask, do you
      direct your steps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will explain as we do ride along. But I must haste: time presses; and
      e'en now I greatly fear me I shall come too late.&rdquo;

      Remounting quickly as these words were said, he then good Augier's
      daughter lifted up and placed upon his horse; for he resolved she should
      not quit his sight until he put her in her father's arms: this done he
      rode apace towards the spot where lay the wounded knight.

      CHAPTER VIII. TAULAT DE RUGUMON.

      href="../44433-page-images/p119.jpg">119</a></span>did help come more in time of need.
      Returned that very morn, Taulat had bound his prisoner to a stake; and
      four stout ploughmen, each armed with a strap, already raised their brawny
      arms to strike and ope the closed wounds. But as Jaufry came, they stayed
      their hand to gaze awhile at him; nor less surprised than they, Taulat,
      who on the castle-terrace stood, descended in hot haste and thus accosted
      Jaufry: &ldquo;Sir knight, I fain would learn what madness or what pride hath
      thus conducted thee into my lands. Dismount and doff thine arms, for thou
      art prisoner henceforth for ay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; the knight replied, &ldquo;methinks you practise an unseemly haste.
      Give me, I beg, the time to <span class="pagenum"><a name="link120"       id="link120"></a><a href="../44433-page-images/p120.jpg">120</a></span>tell my errand.
      I come to speak in favour of the knight your knaves were going to strike;
      and I entreat you, for the sake of me, to grant unto him grace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May Heaven help me!&rdquo; Taulat answered him, &ldquo;but sure thou art distraught:
      such words deserve the rope,&mdash;a peasant's death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Twould be a grievous wrong, my lord, the words being good and wise;
      again I do repeat them, praying grace for yonder knight, who seven long
      years hath groaned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, churl; too long I've listed; go and disarm thyself, if thou wilt
      live, and to my squires give up the girl with thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she's dishonoured and I put to shame, this arm, by Heaven, must indeed
      be weak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! wouldst thou fight with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;E'en unto death, before I suffer shame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vain fool, beware; when on my neck I've put my shield, thoult find but
      little grace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine ear,&rdquo; quoth Jaufry, &ldquo;hath been oft assailed by higher threats than
      these. I do reply, that, by the faith of Him who built this world, you
      shall set free yon knight, and to the court of good King Arthur go, to pay
      the felony you there have done; or you shall <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link121" id="link121"></a><a href="../44433-page-images/p121.jpg">121</a></span>fight
      with me, till you or I be vanquished and slain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Know'st thou then not, I've fought and conquered full five hundred
      knights, all better men than thou?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be so,&rdquo; quoth Jaufry; &ldquo;now for proof: go get your arms, and God's
      high will be done!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No other armour,&rdquo; proudly Taulat said, &ldquo;do I require than my good lance
      and shield: seven of thy strength might then come on, and I'd defy you
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis madness,&rdquo; did Sir Jaufry make reply, &ldquo;to enter fight unarmed. But
      since your pride doth blind your senses so, e'en have it as you will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Furious at the words, Taulat addressed a squire: &ldquo;Go to the castle,
      quickly as thou canst; bring me my lance and shield, and tell the knights
      I've conquered one by one to meet me here, that they may witness a base
      peasant's death, as with a single blow I do intend, through shield and
      hauberk, to find out his heart. And at the instant should this not be
      done, may I lose arms and chivalry and lady's love!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The squire ran quickly to the scattered camp, where lodged the captive
      knights,&mdash;who all were grieving for the wounded man, bound to the
      stake and waiting for the scourge,&mdash;to them he briefly said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barons, <span class="pagenum"><a name="link122" id="link122"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p122.jpg">122</a></span>my lord attends you there beyond,
      that you may see him battle with a fool, who comes to seek his death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mounting then speedily the castle-stair,&mdash;amid the tears and murmurs
      of the dames who ceaseless mourned,&mdash;he took him down the shield and
      lance suspended to the rack, and bore them to his lord, who, vaulting on
      his horse, nor stopping to don breastplate or aught else, cried in a
      haughty tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to thy death, thou churl, whose sight offends me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Jaufry, angered at the insult, then dashed at full speed upon the
      haughty knight, who like a lion came: so fearful was the shock, no saddle,
      girth, or art, availed Sir Jaufry. Down to the earth he rolled beneath the
      stroke. But not alone; for Taulat on his side, by blow as vigorous and
      deftly put, at the same instant fell, his shield pierced through, and
      Jaufry's lance within his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      A shout of joy upsprang from those good knights:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heaven, but this day thou chast'nest Taulat, and dost break that
      pride which long hath vexed the land!&rdquo;'
    </p>
    <p>
      Jaufry meanwhile, his sword within his grasp, ran to <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link123" id="link123"></a><a href="../44433-page-images/p123.jpg">123</a></span>fierce
      Rugimon, fast pinned to earth, as though some snake he were; but as he
      came, Taulat in humble tone exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God's love, knight, O do not end thy work; for 'tis my folly that
      hath brought my death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thy folly, true, was great,&rdquo; Sir Jaufry said; &ldquo;but ere we part, I count
      on curing thee. Too long this pride endured, it now must have an end. Thou
      deem'st this morn no knight was in the world who in address and strength
      could vie with thee. Most brave no doubt thou wast; but thy consuming and
      most wicked pride exceeded far thy valour, and 'tis a vice God neither
      loves nor bears. Thou now canst learn that, but for His resolve to chasten
      thee, this youthful arm,&mdash;certes less robust than thine,&mdash;would
      ne'er have cast thee down. 'Tis but the punishment for thy fierce pride,
      the outrage thou to good King Arthur didst,&mdash;that flower of chivalry,
      whose uprightness God loves. And thus it fares with those who seek his
      shame: sooner or later will the knights, who sit at his Round Table famed,
      mete out their punishment, save 'neath the earth they hide. What they can
      do in fight, thou mayst surmise by me, a novice, scarcely two months
      armed, and who have sought thee day and night until this <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link124" id="link124"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p124.jpg">124</a></span>hour, when thou dost find the
      guerdon of thy deeds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that thou sayst, sir knight, is but too true,&rdquo; Taulat replied in weak
      and failing voice; &ldquo;but mercy grant me, as thy conquered foe, as dying
      man, and who doth yield to thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The mercy that thou prayst for, thou shalt have,&rdquo; Sir Jaufry said; &ldquo;but
      upon certain terms: first, thou shalt go to good King Arthur's court,
      there yield thyself a prisoner; he will take such vengeance on thee as his
      honour claims.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will I do; but now, for Heaven's sake, permit the leech to bind me
      up this wound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No leech shall come, nor e'er shalt thou uprise, till, by St. Thomas,
      thou hast let go free the knight who's bound to yonder cruel stake, and
      all the captives thou hast ever made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do as thou wilt, my lord, with them and me.&rdquo; Jaufry at once did sheathe
      his own good blade and take the sword of Taulat. Then he allowed the
      squire to fetch the leech, who probed his master's hurt and washed the
      wound with water and white wine, when on a couch he had him gently laid,
      and borne within the gates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jaufry <span class="pagenum"><a name="link125" id="link125"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p125.jpg">125</a></span>meanwhile set free the wounded
      knight; and having extorted from the captive lords their promise that
      they'd hasten to Carlisle, and to King Arthur this affair relate, he was
      about to leave them to God's care, when the wounded knight,&mdash;lord
      paramount of all those gentlemen,&mdash;most humbly to him said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good sir, to you I yield, and with my person offer men and lands. Most
      nobly have you won all this and more, in freeing me from all the pangs
      I've borne for seven weary years. So great those pangs, so cruel was my
      lot, better for me had death relieved my woes. Taulat, without a cause of
      enmity, hath tortured me full long; but now, by God's grace, and, sir
      knight, by yours, at length his reign is o'er.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good lord,&rdquo; responded Jaufry, &ldquo;pray retain your having; naught do I wish
      for your deliverance, save that, with these brave knights, you do proceed
      to good King Arthur's throne, and there explain you owe your liberty to
      Dovon's son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The knight such promise gave; when Jaufry, calling for his horse, which
      all prepared they brought, while Augier's daughter mounted by his side, he
      took of all farewell, and then set out for the fair damsel's home; <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link126" id="link126"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p126.jpg">126</a></span>his thoughts, in sooth, turning to
      Brunissende, towards whom he felt his heart most sweetly drawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had gone, Taulat returned the knights their steeds and arms, and,
      by the compact made, departed in their train for fair Carlisle. There they
      arrived upon the eleventh day. The worthy king gave audience to a dame,
      who, bathed in tears, her castle was to lose within a week, if she no
      champion found to meet her foe. When he had listed to her dolorous words,
      the king aggrieved replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady, were Gawain here, most willingly would he defend your cause; but he
      is not: nor have I Dovon's son, nor Ivan bold, nor any of the braves of my
      Round Table. If of the knights who here surround my throne, there's
      standing one who'll venture your defence, great is the honour that shall
      be his meed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But no one made reply. In vain the dame, turning to spurred heels, with
      warmth exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Fore Heaven, brave knights, shall it be said a woman came to seek in
      this high court for aid, yet found it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still no one made reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Twas at this moment Taulat's troop appeared; himself upon a gilded litter
      laid, covered with sumptuous <span class="pagenum"><a name="link127"       id="link127"></a><a href="../44433-page-images/p127.jpg">127</a></span>cloth, and
      gently by two snowy palfries borne. Five hundred knights he had in fight
      overthrown, armed <i>cap-à-pie</i>, followed in his train, each mounted on
      a charger richly decked. Their lord was at their head, who, as they
      reached the king, knelt humbly down before that monarch's throne, and thus
      addressed him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, may He who for our weal came down on earth, which eke His blood
      bedewed, now grant you joy, and double your renown!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, friend, may He save!&rdquo; the king replied. &ldquo;But what, I pray, are
      these, who seem so stout and good? And what the wounded man that litter
      holds?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord, that man is Taulat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Taulat de Rugimon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord, the same; Jaufry, the son of Dovon, bravely vanquished him, and
      hither sends him to the queen and you; so that you may, my lord, such
      vengeance take as in your wisdom you consider fit, for that same outrage,
      now two months agone, he did to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven and earth,&rdquo; King Arthur then exclaimed, &ldquo;how well hath Jaufry
      served me! Friend, tell me truth: when last you left him, was he safe and
      sound?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great <span class="pagenum"><a name="link128" id="link128"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p128.jpg">128</a></span>lord, he was, as doth comport such
      honoured and brave knight, who hath nor grief nor fear. Naught else but
      good can harbour with his name; and it were sweet to laud, if that his
      acts did not upraise him more than words can ever reach. When you shall
      know from what most cruel fate his valour hath snatched <i>me</i>, you
      will indeed be full of wonderment. But this recital must before the queen
      and all her dames be made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king at once commanded unto Quex to go and seek the queen; the
      seneschal obeyed, when meeting her,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if it so meet your wish, the king, your lord and mine,
      bids you to come and list a message brought by valiant knight who heads a
      great escort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The queen at once proceeded to the hall with all her dames and damsels;
      and when she placed herself beside her spouse, Melyan, the worthy knight,
      addressed them thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady, from brave Sir Jaufry, Dovon's son, I bring high reparation to
      yourself and all your train. I bring you Taulat, hight of Rugimon, that
      you may vengeance take for the affront that he hath done to you, <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link129" id="link129"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p129.jpg">129</a></span>and for the cruelty he's heaped on
      me. Learn, without motive he my father slew, and me he wounded with such
      grievous hurt, that ne'er shall I be healed. I was his captive in his
      castle kept; and when my wound had closed, he to a stake did have me
      bound, and scourged by cruel hands until the wound again was open laid.
      Each month did I this martyrdom endure; which caused such dire despair
      throughout my lands, that, thrice by day and thrice again by night, they
      gave aloose to tears and doleful cries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Heaven,&rdquo; exclaimed the worthy king at this, &ldquo;what felon act!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By all the saints of heaven,&rdquo; said the queen, &ldquo;this was the reign of
      haughty pride run wild!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yea,&rdquo; from the litter did Taulat respond, &ldquo;I had, good sooth, most
      wicked, foolish pride; but I have lost it all. A leech appeared, who in a
      space most brief did work a cure. I sought in vain a knight who could make
      head against me, and I've found my match. Never did better jouster wield a
      lance: modest as brave, and generous as good, spite of my insults,&mdash;which
      did merit death,&mdash;Sir Jaufry gave me grace, and granted pardon. You,
      noble sire, who are the best of kings, deign but to imitate his clemency,
      find <span class="pagenum"><a name="link130" id="link130"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p130.jpg">130</a></span>pardon give for that most foolish
      crime I here did madly do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The worthy king, alway to good inclined, his pardon freely granted to the
      knight; nay more, he used such reasons with the queen, that Guenever, as
      generous, noble dame, her pardon likewise gave. Melyan alone remained
      inflexible. Rejecting all entreaty, he resolved, as was his right, since
      his was <i>corporal shame</i>, that Taulat should be judged by legal
      court.
    </p>
    <p>
      At once they called a hundred legists in, who, when they'd heard the
      cause, the following sentence did at once proclaim:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Taulat to Melyan shall be given up; who, month by month, shall bind him
      to like stake, and by like hands on him inflict like punishment. The court
      doth grant this power unto Melyan for seven years; with liberty albeit in
      him to set his prisoner free whene'er he feel inclined to grant him
      grace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At <span class="pagenum"><a name="link131" id="link131"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p131.jpg">131</a></span>the same hour the legists sentence
      passed, Sir Jaufry, riding quickly with the maid, before the towers of
      Augier arrived. Warned of his coming by the vassals' cries, who gave him
      joyful welcome and warm thanks for having set their lord and suzerain
      free, Augier mounted quickly on his horse, and with his sons came out to
      meet the knight. Beside Sir Jaufry he perceived the maid, guiding with
      sweeter grace than I can tell her gentle palfrey; but he knew her not, for
      she was veiled. Descending from his horse as he approached the knight, who
      eke alighted as he saw him come, he seized his hand, and with a trembling
      voice,&mdash;&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;within my castle come, as you did
      promise me. We will most gladly there a welcome give, albeit my heart is
      melting with its woe. Since <span class="pagenum"><a name="link132"       id="link132"></a><a href="../44433-page-images/p132.jpg">132</a></span>last we two did
      meet, a monster hath my daughter carried off, and with her all my joys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did not guard her with sufficient care,&rdquo; Sir Jaufry mildly said,
      &ldquo;since she is gone. What now remains to do? It was to be. None can avert
      his fate; so be consoled, and dry at once your tears. Some days agone I
      won a maid in fight, gentle and lovely as a maid can be; and if you will,
      to you I'll give her up, that she may take the place of her that's lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, my lord,&rdquo; good Augier replied, &ldquo;where is the damsel or the dame
      that can compete with her in grace, in gentle manners, gaiety, and love?
      Her like is still unborn; and for my rest of days this world to me can
      naught, alas, afford of happiness or ease.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I do still the contrary affirm; and more than that, declare that you
      this damsel shall her equal find in beauty and in love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In speaking thus Sir Jaufry raised her veil; and Augier looking, his sweet
      daughter knew. When he had pressed her often in his arms, a thousand
      grateful thanks bestowed on Jaufry, and listed to the tale of his exploits
      with Taulat and the giant, he to the castle led the way, the serfs and
      vassals following in troops.
    </p>
    <p>
      Great <span class="pagenum"><a name="link133" id="link133"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p133.jpg">133</a></span>was the honour they there showed
      the knight: the brothers poured the water for his use, the damsel served
      him with her own fair hands a roasted peacock nobly bedecked, and Augier
      fain had kept him there a month; but Jaufry, frankly owning that his heart
      allured him to Montbrun, set out the morrow mom. Escorted by his host and
      his two sons he took his way, musing on Brunissende; when, at the hour of
      noon, he met her seneschal, just then returned from fair Carlisle, where
      he had Taulat seen and Melyan and the five hundred knights from bondage
      freed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He still was seeking by his dame's command brave Dovon's son; but
      half-despaired success. Scarcely, however, did he learn the truth, that
      Melyan's saviour and the weary knight who in the orchard slumbered were
      the same, when, urging his horse, ne'er did he stop until Montbrun was
      reached, where travel-soiled he came to Brunissende.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is the knight?&rdquo; asked she before the man could e'en unclose his
      lips. &ldquo;Cometh he on? shall I soon see him here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He follows me, fair lady,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;but such his deeds, whereof the
      saving of our lord from pain and torment is but one, that I do think
      'twere well you met <span class="pagenum"><a name="link134" id="link134"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p134.jpg">134</a></span>the knight, and with a hundred
      damsels formed escort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The thought pleased Brunissende. She orders gave to deck the roads with
      green, to hang rich stuffs and silk, damask and doth-of-gold, upon the
      castle-walls; while she herself, mounting her palfrey white, with all her
      court and knights and damsels fair, went out to meet Sir Jaufry. Arrayed
      most richly in a silken robe with trimmings of pure gold, she had upon her
      blondin tresses placed a gorgeous wreath, where peacock's feathers shone;
      while in her hand she bore the choicest flowers from her garden culled. No
      wonder, then, if Jaufry were surprised to see her come thus lovely, full
      of grace, and smiling as the queen of the sweet south. With courteous
      words they met, and side by side to Montbrun's lordly halls together they
      returned.

      Jaufry and Brunissende the fair alone nor ate nor oped their lips. The
      lady glanced at Jaufry with a sigh, and each sweet glance shot through his
      softened eyes and fell into his heart; while Jaufry, on his side, at every
      moment blushed, and through the very marrow of his bones by dart <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link135" id="link135"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p135.jpg">135</a></span>invisible did feel that he was
      pierced. Musing of love, the live-long night they watched till rosy
      morning came. In her chamber the fair lady, and Jaufry on his gorgeous
      couch, thought but of the gentle speeches they would make the morrow mom;
      and, when once the sun had risen, they were up and quickly clad; and when
      mass at length was over, side by side they sat them down in the great hall
      of the castle, where they oped their swelling hearts.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Twas Brunissende who first the silence broke; for, dazzled by her beauty,
      Jaufry lost in gazing on her face the pretty speeches he had framed
      o'ernight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; she said, in voice of sweetest tone, &ldquo;your coming brings us joy
      and happiness; no service could be higher than the one you've rendered us;
      and bless we good King Arthur in his knight, bless we the land which
      claims so brave a man, and&mdash;bless we too the lady for whose sake such
      noble acts are done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas,&rdquo; sighed Jaufry, at this latter phrase, &ldquo;no lady cares for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak in jest,&rdquo; said then fair Brunissende; &ldquo;your sense and valour
      raise you up too high for noble lady not to care for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> care perhaps for <i>her</i>; not she for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knows <span class="pagenum"><a name="link136" id="link136"></a><a

      her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot say, fair lady, if she guess; but I ne'er told my love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No blame can then at least alight on her: if you ne'er seek where lies
      the remedy of that same evil whereof you complain, who is in the wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis I, sweet lady, I. Her greatness curbs me, fills me with strange
      fears; I cannot ask her love, for ne'er an emperor who trod this earth but
      by that love were honoured;&mdash;such is the height, above all other
      dames, to which she's raised by sovereign grace and wealth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you now say is folly, gallant knight; emperors and kings ne'er won
      in true love's lists a greater prize than brave and courteous man: such
      love holds not to riches; noble heart and gentle grace have in his court
      more power than lands and titles. How many, folks there are of high
      descent whose worth is valued highly at a groat! How many others rolling
      in bright gold whose value would not buy a coat of mail! Hide, then, no
      longer in your single heart the thought with which it's filled; your
      valour and your deeds give you a claim to match upon this earth with the
      most fair, most high.&rdquo;

      Sir <span class="pagenum"><a name="link137" id="link137"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p137.jpg">137</a></span>Jaufry heaved a sigh, and thus,
      much moved, replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady, forgive, I pray you, the avowal which you, forsooth, are destined
      now to hear,&mdash;avowal that no torture e'er had drawn, but which is due
      to those sweet words of yours. You, then, are she for whom my heart doth
      melt; she whom I love and fear and I implore; she who doth hold the keys
      of all my joys, my pains, and who can make of me, even at her will,
      foolish or wise, a coward or a brave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At length had Brunissende the fair attained the sum of her desire; yet she
      her joy concealed, and in a tone of playfulness exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Jaufry, you are pleased to banter me; ne'er can I think I have the
      power you say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thousand times more power, you may believe, than I can ever tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That we shall prove right soon,&rdquo; she made reply. &ldquo;The age is spoiled by
      wicked usages: true courtesy is lost, and he who warmly vows that he doth
      love too oft but utters lies. If you full truly wish to have <i>my</i>
      love, I must be wed as well as wooed, my lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Jaufry cared not, you may well believe, such offer to refuse. He had
      just vowed by Peter and St.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul <span class="pagenum"><a name="link138" id="link138"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p138.jpg">138</a></span>naught upon earth such joy could
      give to him, when a knight entered, heating on his shield, to announce the
      coming of the Lord of Brunissende.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To horse, good knights, to horse!&rdquo; the lady cried; when lords and
      damsels, mounting in hot haste, went out to meet their suzerain.
    </p>
    <p>
      As thus the cavalcade rode gaily off, headed by Jaufry and fair
      Brunissende, they saw approach two ladies dressed in black, with eyes all
      red and swimming with fresh tears. Jaufry saluted them, and then inquired
      for tidings of Lord Melyan; but one of them in under-tone replied, and
      with a sigh, that of Lord Melyan nothing did she know; she thought but of
      her woes. *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * This is the original of Cervantes' Princess Micomicona:

     &ldquo;Es matar a un gigantazo que lo pide es la alta princesa
     Micomicona, reyna del gran reyno Micomicon&rdquo; (D. Quijote,
     parte i. lib. iv. cap. xxix.).
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell us,&rdquo; said Jaufry, &ldquo;why you shed these tears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you do wish to know, my lord, I'll speak the truth. A knight,
      misshapen, and ill-bred to boot, wishes to force on me his odious love;
      and I in grief have left King Arthur's court, where I have neither found
      advice nor aid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You <span class="pagenum"><a name="link139" id="link139"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p139.jpg">139</a></span>do astonish me,&rdquo; Sir Jaufry cried;
      &ldquo;where was Sir Gawain then? Ivan the courteous, Coedis that brave knight,
      Tristrem and Calogrant, Lancelot du Lac, Eric and Caravis, and bitter
      Quex,&mdash;pray, where were they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it not, by Heaven, good my lord; nor have I any trust but in Sir
      Jaufry, that most famous knight, whom now I seek, that he may turn my
      fate, and my good right maintain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will maintain it, certes,&rdquo; then Jaufry said; &ldquo;for I am he, the Jaufry
      whom you seek; but I must first conclude a matter here which before all
      things claims my every thought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mourning lady wept and urged her suit, spite of the angry looks of
      Brunissende. Sir Jaufry would not yield, but to Montbrun with Melyan
      straight returned. The lady there, giving all cause to think that to her
      suzerain she bowed her will, was for long time entreated she her hand
      should give to Dovon's son; then they set out for Carlisle's gallant
      court, and in their train were twice twelve hundred maids, and full three
      thousand knights in brilliant arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three first days of travel naught occurred; but on the fourth, having
      pitched their tents in a green <span class="pagenum"><a name="link140"       id="link140"></a><a href="../44433-page-images/p140.jpg">140</a></span>mead, balmy
      with flowers, and shut in with trees, Jaufry and Melyan suddenly did hear
      a voice which help implored in piercing tone. The son of Dovon called for
      horse and arms, and would alone go seek this cause of wail. He thus
      arrived upon the borders of a pond of some extent and limpid water, where
      a damsel stood tearing her hair and robe, and, in her grief, her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; she cried, as Jaufry hastened up, &ldquo;have pity, for St. Mary's
      sake, upon a dame who in this pond is drowning; she was the best, the
      wisest of her sex.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jaufry advanced; and there, in truth, he saw, within the waters battling
      with death, a dame, who now appeared, now slid beneath the wave. He soon
      alighted, and his efforts used to save her with the butt-end of his lance;
      but whilst his arm was thus outstretched, and he stood by the brink, the
      damsel pushed him with such hearty will, at once he toppled in, which she
      perceiving, leapt in after him.

    <p>
      Drawn downward by the great weight of his arms, Sir Jaufry disappeared
      with those two dames. The neighing and the rage of his good horse, which
      pawed the ground and madly bit the earth about the <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link141" id="link141"></a><a href="../44433-page-images/p141.jpg">141</a></span>pond,
      announced this dire mischance to Melyan. He hastened there; and finding
      Jaufry drowned, he swooned away. 'Twas then the rest, 'mong whom the news
      had flown, galloped frill speed towards that fatal pond. Force was
      required to drag Lord Melyan off; for, when restored, he tried to drown
      himself; and, for fair Brunissende, she by her seneschal was barely saved,
      since, Jaufry lost, she would not him survive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joining her cries to dames' and damsels' moans and to the lamentations of
      her lords,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Jaufry, Jaufry!&rdquo; sobbed she wildly out, &ldquo;frank, generous knight,
      all-powerful at arms, who then hath ta'en thy life? Some traitor-blow hath
      struck thee by surprise; for living man could ne'er have fairly won. O
      Jaufry! lone on earth, what good am I? Worthless is life, which keeps me
      far from thee. I pray for death, which comes not at my call. Where shall I
      seek this truant senseless death, which will not reunite me to my love?
      There 'neath yon water doth his body lie, which calls me, waits in vain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then suddenly upspringing, lost, and mad with grief, she to the
      treach'rous water wildly flew; and 'twas by dint of strength they dragg'd
      her back. Then she <span class="pagenum"><a name="link142" id="link142"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p142.jpg">142</a></span>her tresses tore, her lovely face,
      till in a swoon her woe and sense were numbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good Augier had her carried to her tent, where on her couch the damsels
      laid her down; then he returned, and with the other knights around the
      fatal wave did weep and groan. Such were their tears, their mourning, and
      their cries, that the archbishop learnt the fatal news, and to console
      that doleful train proceeded to the mead.
    </p>
    <p>
      With wisdom there he preached, and in his sermon said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friends, the Scripture teacheth us that God is master of all things,
      and when He pleaseth can again resume those gifts He hath bestowed. If,
      then, Sir Jaufry hath been ta'en by Him, He, as His work, might freely
      call him back; and it were sin to find such judgment ill, and felony
      towards our Sovereign Lord. They among you who held this brave knight
      dear, should now to heaven pray he may be saved; and should at once give
      o'er these cries of woe, as vain rebuke towards your Heavenly King.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER X. THE GIANT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      While the archbishop preached beside the pond, Sir Jaufry found himself
      with those two dames in a delicious land. Valley and plain, water and
      shady grove, city and castle,&mdash;all was charming there.

    <p>
      Before he well recovered his surprise, the lovelier of his two companions
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I now, sir knight, do hold you in my power; perchance this time you'll
      not refuse to do the service which with tears I begged of you some so
      short days agone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; Sir Jaufry wondering replied, &ldquo;methinks I ne'er set eyes on you
      before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am that weeping dame who did entreat you to defend her rights 'gainst
      Felon d'Albaru, a wicked wretch, <span class="pagenum"><a name="link144"       id="link144"></a><a href="../44433-page-images/p144.jpg">144</a></span>whom God
      confound! This monster, who doth not deserve the name of knight, since he
      doth naught but plan most villain acts and set vile snares, bears on his
      shoulders more the head of horse or bull than that of living man. His eyes
      are large as eggs; his features horrible; his lips are thick and black;
      his fangs project from out his mouth, which is itself huge as a leopard's
      jaw; and against nature are his frightful shape, distended body, and
      misshapen legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis not to fright you, good my lord, I draw this portrait of my foe,&mdash;your
      heart ne'er harboured fear: but true it is, he doth all men alarm; so that
      his aspect, at a distance seen, doth scare away all such as would defend
      my cause. As yet in fight invincible, he hath despoiled my lands and all
      the country round; I but my castle now have left to me, and that tomorrow
      must be given up, if God and you oppose not such decree. But I would
      rather suffer torture, death, than fall into his power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is all this true?&rdquo; asked Jaufry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yea, lord, by the faith!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since yours' the right, I'll battle with this foe; but you have wrong'd
      me, and fair Brunissende hath certes her thoughts on death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She,&rdquo; <span class="pagenum"><a name="link145" id="link145"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p145.jpg">145</a></span>said the lady, &ldquo;fear not, will not
      die; and you will me have saved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As thus discoursing, they the castle reached; a building strong,
      surrounded by good walls, with fosses, cut from out the solid rock, filled
      with a living stream. Jaufry was there most grandly entertained by that
      fair lady's vassals; and mom come, when he had dressed and armour buckled
      on, bathed well his face and hands, and prayed to Heaven to give him grace
      that day and strength to uphold the right of the oppressed, he with
      humility attended mass, and gave seven marks of silver.
    </p>
    <p>
      When mass was done, he to the terrace mounted with the dame and with her
      damsels, and watched for Felon's coming. Short space elapsed during their
      stopping there, he suffering in his heart for Brunissende's just grief,
      ere a bright band of knights appeared upon the plain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; he then inquired, &ldquo;is this our foe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis he, my lord, with all his train. He rides ahead of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him then come, and we will hear his cause.&rdquo; Felon came gently on,
      bearing upon his fist a hawk most rare as it was beautiful. It had a
      slender neck, a <span class="pagenum"><a name="link146" id="link146"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p146.jpg">146</a></span>large beak sharper than a razor's
      edge, long wings, a tail a palm at least in length, a sinewy leg, and
      strong and shapely foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as he came beneath the castle-walls, Felon perceived some hundred
      cranes all grouped about the grass of a small verdant close; at once he
      loosed the hawk, which flying off, began to wheel about the grassy spot,
      then rose up in the air to such vast height, scarce could the eye detect
      his presence there. Some time elapsed, then straightway down he shot, and
      pounced upon the cranes with cry so dread, that, fluttering and hiding in
      the grass, they let themselves by Felon's men be caught without attempting
      to escape away.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had thus some dozens of them ta'en, Felon recalled the bird,
      which on his fist again returned to perch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Heaven!&rdquo; quoth Jaufry, muttering half-aloud, &ldquo;that man possesseth a
      right precious bird; never was finer seen or one more stanch; and could I
      win it, and return above, 'twould be a worthy present for the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall return full soon, my gentle lord,&rdquo; the lady smiling said, &ldquo;and
      shall bear with you, I have little doubt, both Felon's bird and arms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During <span class="pagenum"><a name="link147" id="link147"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p147.jpg">147</a></span>this time the giant had drawn near;
      and when he stood before the castle-bridge, with all his strength he
      cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come down, all you who there above do stand; and with you bring along
      that idle jade, whom I will make the servant of my squires.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said Jaufry calmly in reply, &ldquo;if you left here the jade whereof
      you speak, pray you to point her out, and none will strive such person to
      detain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know full well the meaning of my words. Give up the dame and castle,
      as agreed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All covenant is sacred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So give up the dame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you please, my lord,&rdquo; Sir Jaufry said, &ldquo;where is the right by
      which you claim such prize?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The right of my good pleasure, signor knave; who soon shall dangle on a
      hempen rope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis an ill answer, savouring great pride. But all injustice doth not win
      its end. You would abuse your strength against a woman having no defence.
      Go arm yourself; for Heaven hath sent her one who will maintain her
      right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An the saints help me,&rdquo; Felon then replied, &ldquo;you shall pay dearly for
      those words of yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Giving <span class="pagenum"><a name="link148" id="link148"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p148.jpg">148</a></span>his squire the hawk without delay,
      he donned his hauberk and his armour rich, buckled his helm, and seized
      his lance and shield; when out he cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let that pert knave descend who wants to fight: we soon shall see upon
      this very spot how he doth wield his arms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Jaufry went to put his armour on, and as he did so, made to God his
      prayer; crossed he the drawbridge without noise or vaunt, while the fair
      lady and her vassals knelt and made this orison:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou, Lord, who didst Thy hands upon the cross permit Thy foes to nail,
      and let an infidel pierce through Thy side, now grant to Jaufry strength
      to conquer Felon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The champions met within the verdant close where the hawk chased the
      cranes. And when the giant did Sir Jaufry see, fiercely he cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hast thou thy senses, fool, to dare meet such as I?&mdash;I, who could
      vanquish full a score like thee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;High vaunts like these,&rdquo; Sir Jaufry calmly said, &ldquo;I hold as little worth;
      for idle words are but as empty wind. Now list: if thou wilt render back
      unto the dame who owns yon castle even the smallest thing thou <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link149" id="link149"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p149.jpg">149</a></span>hast unjustly filched from her
      away, thou mayst depart without a scratch or wound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine bargain, on my faith,&rdquo; the giant said; &ldquo;thou dost pretend to grant
      me thy good grace: and I affirm I will not quit this spot till with this
      hand I've torn thee limb from limb.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I no more can list; pride blinds thy sense. Henceforth, then, beware
      of me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Jaufry at these words wheeled round his horse to give him a broad
      field, when at full gallop he did rush at Felon. Seeing him come, the
      latter grasped his shield, and flew to strike him with such dire shock,
      both horse and knight were thrown. But in the encounter Jau-fry's steady
      lance had broken his shield and pierced the arm right through. Like
      lightning Dovon's son was on his feet, his good sword firmly grasped. Mad
      with his wound, Felon came running up, and loudly cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Eore Heaven, villain, thy last hour is come, and without mercy shall thy
      carcass swing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was his thought to pin him to the earth; but Jaufry dealt his horse so
      true a blow, it clean shaved off his head. So both were now afoot, and
      front to front with the same arms: now we shall shortly learn which is the
      better knight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Felon, <span class="pagenum"><a name="link150" id="link150"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p150.jpg">150</a></span>all pale, with foam upon his lips,
      struck with his sword upon Sir Jaufry's helm a blow so strong, it pared
      the visor off; the latter dealt him in his turn a stroke which made his
      shield-arm droop. But such the force with which he gained this point his
      sword escaped his hand. This Felon seeing, he his foot placed on't, so
      that the knight might not resume the blade; then he again assailed him
      with such strength, fire flew from out his helm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yield thee, sir knight!&rdquo; the giant fiercely cried, &ldquo;since thou art now
      disarmed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Jaufry answered not, but raised his shield to ward a blow that seemed
      intended to conclude the fight; for Felon's sword fell on it with such
      force, it shivered it in bits, and full two feet the blade struck in the
      earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quick as the lightning's flash the youthful knight darted to raise his
      own, which when he held, he turned again on Felon. He, humbled in his
      pride, exclaimed aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy, sir knight; O, mercy! pray restrain thine hand, and hold me at a
      ransom!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you speak thus,&rdquo; Sir Jaufry made reply, dragging the giant's sword
      from out the ground, &ldquo;render <span class="pagenum"><a name="link151"       id="link151"></a><a href="../44433-page-images/p151.jpg">151</a></span>yourself to <i>her</i>
      you have so oppressed. As for myself, no ransom do I wish saving yon hawk
      which chased erewhile the cranes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felon then called about him all his knights, who bore him to the castle.
      There, when the leech had bound his gaping wounds, they laid him on a
      couch borne by two quiet steeds; whilst the fair dames, followed by
      numerous train, led Jaufry back to where they brought him from.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI. THE COURT OF CARLISLE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Lord Melyan <span class="pagenum"><a name="link153" id="link153"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p153.jpg">153</a></span>and his troop were still encamped
      upon the borders of the magic pond. Judge their surprise, their shouts,
      their whirl of joy, when, 'mid a numerous train, Sir Jaufry rose!
    </p>
    <p>
      As for fair Brunissende, so great the emotion which such change produced,
      it found no vent in words, but in a swoon she fell into his arms. Jaufry
      related how the fairy's art had to her country led him through the deep
      and darksome waters; how he had vanquished her great giant foe, and gained
      the wondrous hawk for the good king. Then, the recital o'er, they gaily
      took their way, and at the peep of the next following morn they saw fair
      Carlisle's towers. Leaving their train a little way behind, Jaufry and
      Melyan, clad in armour bright, pranced on the glacis with eight chosen
      knights. <span class="pagenum"><a name="link154" id="link154"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p154.jpg">154</a></span>Such a brarado at King Arthur's
      court could not unnoticed pass. Quex, the high seneschal, soon crossed the
      bridge, and meeting Jaufry, cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good sooth, sir knight, thou shalt repent thy coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis thou shalt feel repentance more than I,&rdquo; responded Jaufry, who
      divined the man, and meeting him full speed, did with such strength and
      art assail Sir Quex, he hurled him to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he essayed to struggle to his feet, he reeled a pace, then fell, while
      Jaufry cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why how now, jolly Quex? what say'st, art drunk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gawain had now appeared upon the field, spurring his horse to join in the
      affray. Sir Jaufry went to meet the worthy lord, and as he yielded up Sir
      Quex's horse:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To you alone, good knight,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I yield.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gawain then knew the voice of Dovon's son, and pressed him in his arms;
      which, when his squire had learnt, he flew to take the tidings to the
      king. Good Arthur overjoyed then left his halls, and with a gallant host
      of knights and lords came forth to honour Taulat's vanquisher. Fair
      Brunissende he courteously did greet with all her train; then, smiling,
      said to Jaufry:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hath, then, our seneschal on you his horse thus gen'rously bestowed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; the son of Dovon made reply, &ldquo;perchance you may remember, on
      the day I begged you arms to follow Taulat's track, Sir Quex exclaimed,
      I'd fight him better drunk. 'Twas then my wish to teach him, good my lord,
      how I can strike when fasting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is well struck, methinks,&rdquo; the king replied; &ldquo;and may the lesson stead
      him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Saying the words, he led Sir Jaufry in to good Queen Guenever, who, as she
      tended him her rosy cheek, thanked him with warmth for having 'venged her
      cause on Taulat. King Arthur on his side did give him thanks for all the
      precious gifts he there had sent,&mdash;the fair white ashen lance, the
      yeoman's dwarf and e'en the leper's too, Estout de Verfeil and the captive
      knights, Melyan, and Taulat's numerous prisoners, with Eclon d'Albaru;
      then was the convent-church most richly decked, to which the king in pomp
      conducted him with the fair Brunissende.

      More than a score of thousand gallant knights the fair betrothed
      accompanied. The good archbishop, who had <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link156" id="link156"></a><a href="../44433-page-images/p156.jpg">156</a></span>chanted
      mass, before the altar joined the happy pair; then to the palace back
      again they came, and the great feast began. At trumpet sound, Lucas the
      royal steward, with twenty thousand pages clad in vests of scarlet silk,
      bearing fine snowy cloths, vases of silver and rich cups of gold, flocked
      to the hall to furnish forth the boards. Already harps had tinkled,
      minstrels tried to charm their hearers with the gay romance, when straight
      into the hall a squire rushed, crying aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To arms! good lords, to arms; defend your lives!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What hast thou seen, good Mend?&rdquo; King Arthur said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O sire, I've seen a bird, a wond'rous bird, which never man of mother
      born described. He hath a beak at least ten palms in length, and a huge
      head large as a fisher's boat; his eyes like carbuncles or diamonds shine;
      and then his feet, good sooth, without a lie they are as big&mdash;as big
      as yonder door. I know not how I did escape his maw; but ne'er methinks
      was I so near my death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring me my arms,&rdquo; exclaimed the gallant king, &ldquo;that I may learn whether
      this squire hath lied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gawain, <span class="pagenum"><a name="link157" id="link157"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p157.jpg">157</a></span>Sir Jaufry, and Lord Melyan, fain
      would follow him to help; but he forbade, and thus alone did quit the
      castle. Scarce had he crossed the bridge, when he beheld this marvellous
      great bird. He quietly drew nigh, his shield on arm, his sword within his
      hand. But, spreading its grand wings, the bird escaped a blow full
      promptly aimed; and by both arms embracing tight the king, rose with its
      prey full swiftly in the air. Ladies and knights despairingly rushed out,
      and o'er the country spread with rending cries. The bird still rose; and
      when in bulk it seemed no bigger than a crane, it then the king let go.
      The crowd, all breathless, hastened to the spot, where they expected that
      their king would fall crushed from that dizzy height. Not so! ere that he
      reached the ground the bird had deftly seized on him again, and to the
      summit of a lofty tower borne him in ease away. Reposing there a space,
      with rapid wing it flew towards the wood, wheeled with a graceful flight,
      then to the palace brought the king again; itself returning to a human
      shape, that of the fair enchanter, whom Arthur pardoned, as he'd done at
      Pentecost, the fright his trick had caused. And thus did close the joyous
      nuptial feast of brave Sir Jaufry and fair Brunissende. <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link158" id="link158"></a><a
      href="../44433-page-images/p158.jpg">158</a></span>The morrow-morn they left the merry
      court; and all the train, which called Sir Melyan lord, escorted back in
      triumph to Montbrun that happy pair, meeting upon their way the lady of
      the pond (she was in fact the fairy of Gibel), who there had come to bless
      their life and love.
